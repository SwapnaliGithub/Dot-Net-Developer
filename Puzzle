Puzzle 7 | (3 Bulbs and 3 Switches)
Last Updated : 19 Jan, 2023
There is a room with a door (closed) and three light bulbs inside the room. Outside the room, there are three switches, connected to the bulbs. 
You may manipulate the switches as you wish, but once you open the door you can’t change them. 
All bulbs are in working condition and you can open the door only once. Identify each switch with respect to its bulb.
Solution:
Let the bulbs be X, Y, and Z 
Turn on switch X for 5 to 10 minutes. Turn it off and turn on switch Y. Open the door and touch the light bulb. 
1. the light is on from the bulb, it is Y 
Now we will check the other two off bulbs 
2. the bulb which is hot, is X 
3. the bulb which is cold, is Z  


Puzzle | 3 cuts to cut round cake into 8 equal pieces
Last Updated : 18 Jan, 2023
Puzzle: You have a birthday cake and have to cut it into 8 equal pieces by making 3 cuts only. How do you do it?
Solution: The solution can be divided into 3 basic steps. But apart from this there are also other method of executing this task.
Step 1: Cut the cake into quarters (4 pieces) using 2 of the cuts – one horizontally down the centre of the cake and the other vertically down the centre of the cake. 
This will leave you with 4 pieces (or slices) of cake.
Step 2: Then take all 4 pieces and arrange them in a stack that is 4 pieces high.
Step 3: Finally, you can just cut that stack of 4 pieces in half – using your third and final cut – and then you will end up with 8 pieces of cake!


Make group of 5 horses and run 5 races. Suppose five groups are [a, b, c, d, e] and next alphabet is its individual rank in this group(of 5 horses).for eg. d3 means horse in group d and has rank 3rd in his group. [ 5 RACES DONE ] 
a1 b1 c1 d1 e1 
a2 b2 c2 d2 e2 
a3 b3 c3 d3 e3 
a4 b4 c4 d4 e4 
a5 b5 c5 d5 e5 

Puzzle 9 | (Find the fastest 3 horses)
Last Updated : 25 May, 2023
There are 25 horses among which you need to find out the fastest 3 horses. 
You can conduct a race among at most 5 to find out their relative speed. At no point, 
you can find out the actual speed of the horse in a race. Find out the minimum no. of races which are required to get the top 3 horses.
Now make a race of (a1,b1,c1,d1,e1).[RACE 6 DONE] suppose result is a1>b1>c1>d1>e1 
which implies a1 must be FIRST. 
b1 and c1 MAY BE(but not must be) 2nd and 3rd. 
FOR II position, horse will be either b1 or a2 
(we have to find top 3 horse therefore we choose horses b1,b2,a2,a3,c1 do racing among them [RACE 7 DONE]. 
The only possibilities are : 
c1 may be third 
b1 may be second or third 
b2 may be third 
a2 may be second or third 
a3 may be third 
The final result will give ANSWER. suppose result is a2>a3>b1>c1>b2 
then answer is a1,a2,a3,b1,c1. 
HENCE ANSWER is 7 RACES 


In the group of these 5 horses, the winner would be the 2nd fastest, and the horse that comes 2nd in the race would be the 3rd fastest!
So using this procedure, we need 7 races to decide the top 3 fastest horses. But the critical question is: why 7 races minimum? Let's think!
To find the fastest, we need to run all 25 horses at least once, and since you can only race 5 horses at a time, you need a minimum of 25/5 = 5 races.
Then we need to compare the winners of these races, which means a 6th race is necessary.
To find the second and third fastest, we need at least one more race to compare the relative speed of the horses.
