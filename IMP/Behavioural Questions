What Skills Do You Want to Develop?
"One of the skills that I am most interested in developing is public speaking.
I have always been a bit nervous about speaking in front of groups, 
but I have been working on my presentation skills through Toastmasters and I have made a lot of progress.
I am confident that with continued practice and exposure, I can become an effective public speaker.
I believe that this skill will be valuable in a number of areas, including client meetings, team meetings, and company presentations. I am excited about the opportunity to continue improving in this area and to contribute to the company's success."

"I am passionate about developing my skills in project management and team leadership. I have had some experience leading small teams in the past, but I recognize that there is always more to learn. I am currently enrolled in a project management certification program and I plan to continue learning through online courses and real-world experience. I am excited about the opportunity to take on more responsibility and to contribute to the success of the team and the company."
