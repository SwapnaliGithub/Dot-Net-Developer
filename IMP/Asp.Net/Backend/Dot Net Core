explain the concept of middleware in asp.net core
In ASP.NET Core, middleware is a software component that handles requests and responses. It is made up of one or more delegate functions. Each delegate function can:
Process the incoming request
Pass control to the next delegate function in the pipeline
Handle the request and produce a response
Perform certain actions before and after the next component is invoked in the pipeline 
Middleware can be used for different purposes, such as:
Authenticating a user
Handling errors
Serving static files such as JavaScript files, CSS files, images, etc. 
Middleware controls how applications behave on the HTTP request. It can do or check something with the request as it comes in or after it's completed. 
You can configure the Request Delegates using the Run, Map, and Use Extension Methods in ASP.NET Core. You can specify a Request Delegate using an in-line anonymous method (called in-line middleware) or specify the Request Delegates using a reusable method. 

How to do database migrations in Entity Framework Core?
Answer
Entity Framework Core (EF Core) includes a feature called Migrations that allows you to make changes to your model and then propagate those changes to your database schema. Here’s a basic overview of performing a migration:

1. Install the necessary packages: EF Core requires certain NuGet packages to perform migrations. Make sure you have the basic Entity Framework Core and EF Core tools packages installed in your project.

2. Create a new Migration: Use the Add-Migration command and provide a name for your migration. This creates a new class in your Migrations folder that contains the changes to be made to the database schema.

Add-Migration MyFirstMigration
3. Update the database: Use the Update-Database command. This applies any pending migrations on the database. EF Core creates the database if it does not exist.

Update-Database
You may opt to provide a specific migration name if you want to update the database to a specific migration rather than the latest.

Remember to treat migrations as a part of your codebase. They need to be kept under source control and applied as part of your deployment process. Well-managed migrations are key to dealing with evolving database schemas.

How is routing implemented in ASP.NET Core MVC compared to ASP.NET MVC?
Answer
There are several differences in how routing is handled in ASP.NET Core MVC compared to ASP.NET MVC.

In ASP.NET MVC, routing was handled through a central RouteConfig file that includes rules for each controller and action method. These routing rules can be either attribute-based or convention-based.
On the other hand, ASP.NET Core MVC uses middleware for routing. It provides two types of routing methodologies – convention-based routing and attribute routing. All the routing information is configured in the Startup.cs file.
In ASP.NET Core MVC, we also have a new feature, Routing to Razor Pages. Razor Pages are a new aspect of ASP.NET Core MVC that allow you to create page-based programming model.
Additionally, ASP.NET Core MVC supports route constraints, which weren’t available in ASP.NET MVC. Route constraints let you restrict how the parameters in the route template are matched.
What are some of the best techniques for optimizing performance in .NET Core applications?
Answer
Optimizing performance in .NET Core applications could involve several techniques:

Caching: It’s about storing data somewhere for future use to speed up the application. .NET Core provides support for several different types of caching including in-memory caching, distributed caching, and response caching.
Asynchronous Programming: Use the async and await keywords to write asynchronous code that’s easier to read, write and manage.
Pooling: Techniques such as Object Pooling or Connection Pooling can be used to recycle objects or connections instead of creating and destroying them frequently.
Optimization of Data Access: Minimize the amount of data that you send over the network and reduce the number of server round trips.
Use of Middleware: Middleware components are used to handle requests and responses. Ensure that unnecessary middleware components are not registered.

Can you explain some possible strategies for managing session state in a distributed .NET Core application?
Answer
Managing session state in a distributed .NET Core application generally involves either a server-side or client-side session management approach.

Server-side session management: It store session data on the server. This strategy involves storing the session state in a database or in-memory data store like Redis. This allows applications running on multiple servers to have access to the shared session data.
Client-side session management: In this strategy, the session state is stored in a client side, usually in cookies or in local storage. This strategy eliminates the need to store session data on the server, which can be especially useful in applications with a large number of users.
Distributed Cache Session Management: ASP.NET Core provides IDistributedCache interface that you can use to store your session state.
Remember to always secure session data, especially when incorporating client-side session management strategies.


3. How do you explain what a service lifetime is?
An interviewer might ask this question to see if you understand the various lifetimes of registered services in .NET Core frameworks. A sound answer outlines the three different service lifetimes with specific explanations of each.

Example: "A service lifetime refers to how long an object lives after being created. The three typical lifetimes are transient, scoped and singleton. Transient lifetimes are ideal for stateless and lightweight services because they get created each time the service container gets used. Scoped lifetimes happen once every connection. Singleton lifetimes happen when initially created and again with each subsequent request from the service container."

6. Share a time you prioritised an IT task over something else and why.
Behavioral questions can help interviewers understand how you might react during a specific situation. Questions like this often give insight into your problem-solving abilities, time management skills and creative thinking. Consider giving an answer that involved a challenging deadline, positive results or potentially unpopular decision to help show how you manage stressful situations.

Example: "My team worked on an application and had a presentation to senior executives. Marketing colleagues wanted updated statistics and project reports from our department, but a team member told me about a system bug during testing runs that affected the show-and-tell portion of the presentation. Though the deadline to share materials with the marketing team drew near, I communicated our troubleshooting took priority and pushed the submission deadline. We addressed the glitch the same day and sent our updated report the next morning. The marketing team appreciated my honesty and ultimately included the updated fix in their presentation to leaders."

7. What are some challenges you face while working with .NET Core?
A question about challenges can show an interviewer how you handle work situations, along with giving insight into your analytical and critical thinking skills. Try focusing your answer on specific situations from your past work experience or projects and describe how you overcame the challenges to best display your tenacity and ability to move past obstacles. Consider using the STAR method of providing answers to situational questions.

Example: "When I first became familiar with .NET Core, I often experienced server overloads and database issues when developing an application for my primary client. I noticed the landing pages worked, though they performed slowly with a lag time that might deter users. I connected with database administrators to monitor settings that allowed us to gain better performance while we further developed the app."

8. What is an action method?
Interviewers often seek to know you have a broad depth and understanding of industry terms, processes and practices. This question can help show your specific knowledge of IT concepts. Consider providing a concise answer that confidently addresses the question.

Example: "An action method executes activity when an HTTP request takes place. It is a controller class that has specific parameters. For example, action method must be public, rather than protected or private. It cannot get overloaded and it cannot be a static method."

9. How would you describe what a cookie is to someone not technologically savvy?
This question can showcase your ability to explain complex processes in simple ways. Because communication is an essential skill in nearly every industry, an interviewer might glean insight into your oral and written communication skills. Consider using straightforward descriptions that someone outside of the IT industry can understand when forming your answer.

Example: "A cookie is a small amount of data stored on your computer, mobile or other devices when you access a website. When you go back to the website again, it knows you have visited before. Cookies allow companies to tailor a website, promotion or offer to you specifically because they already know a bit about you as a consumer. Nearly all sites use cookies and they are relatively safe from viruses and malware."

10. What are caching and response caching in .NET Core?
An interviewer might ask this question to establish your awareness between various caching types and other software development aspects. Technical questions often require a precise response, so consider reviewing primary concepts used in the IT industry and .NET Core specifically to best be prepared.

Example: "Caching is a process that reduces the number of calls to the data source, improving the application's performance and scalability. It essentially stores a copy of the data instead of generating it each time you access the original source. For example, if you visit a specific website or app frequently, some data already on your device let the page run faster, giving you a better user experience. For data that frequently changes, response caching sets parameters for the headers that control caching."


How do you handle exceptions globally in an ASP.NET Core Web API project?
Answer
Global exception handling in ASP.NET Core can be achieved using middleware. The ideal place to handle exceptions is in the middleware pipeline so that it is separate from your application logic, and can trap any unhandled exceptions.

One of the most effective ways is to use the built-in UseExceptionHandler middleware which captures synchronous and asynchronous exceptions. With this middleware, you can redirect to an error handling route or render an error response directly.

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    if (env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
    }
    else
    {
        app.UseExceptionHandler("/api/Error");
    }

    //... rest of the middleware
}
In the above code, when an exception is raised it is handled by the “/api/Error” route.

Another method of handling global exceptions is using UseDeveloperExceptionPage middleware which provides detailed exception information in the local development environment.

List of Most Frequently Asked .Net Interview Questions And Answers to Help You Prepare For The Upcoming Interview:

if you are looking for junior .net interview questions, you can look here

1. What is the ASP.NET Life Cycle, and list the types of Life Cycle?
Application Life Cycle: The user requests for accessing the application.
Page Life Cycle: Page Life Cycle has phases like initialization, restoring, execution, and page rendering.
2. What is the Yield keyword and use of in C#?
✔𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝘆𝗶𝗲𝗹𝗱 𝗿𝗲𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗻 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝗺𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗿𝘆 𝘂𝘀𝗮𝗴𝗲 .A yield keyword is used with an iterator method. It enables your to iterate over a collection one after the other without loading the entire collection into memory. It’s a powerful tool for writing more efficient and clean code.


3. Event vs Delegate
Delegate can be passed as a method parameter. An event is raised but cannot be passed as a method parameter.
You can override an event in C# but delegate not override.

Delegates are independent on events but, events can not be created without delegate.
A delegate is declared outside a class whereas, an event is declared inside a class.
Covariance and Contravariance provide extra flexibility to the delegate objects. On the other hand, event has no such concepts.
One difference that events and delegates have. That is delegates support ‘=’ assignment operator, events do not.
If you write your system with just delegate, the consumer may use ‘=’ operator to attach method without error. Now what issue this would introduce? As we said, the event can be subscribed by many components, so if we want to use delegates we must use ‘+=’ to support many methods. Suppose, someone forgets to use ‘+=’ and uses ‘=’, he will unknowingly detach all attached methods and attach only his method. This will be a big mess as other components will never receive event notification.

4. What is Attributes ?
Attributes are a powerful feature in the C# programming language that can add metadata information to your assemblies.Reflection is the ability to examine and modify the runtime behavior of an assembly at run time. Attributes can be used to provide additional information about a program element.

Attributes can be used for a variety of purposes, such as:

Documenting the code
Enforcing coding standards
Metadata Access at Runtime
Customizing the behavior of the compiler or runtime
5. Dynamic vs object
All variables are statically typed by default. However, you can use the dynamic keyword to declare a dynamically typed variable. This means that the compiler does not know the type of the variable and cannot perform type checking.


Dynamically typed variables can be useful in situations where you do not know the type of the variable at compile time. For example, you could use a dynamically typed variable to store a value that is returned from a method that you do not know the return type of.

6. Interface vs abstract class
Inheritance: One classes can implement multiple interface, whereas multiple classes can inherit from the one abstract class in C#.
Accessibility:Members of an interface are public by default, while members of an abstract class can have any accessibility level.
Implementation: In an interface, the implementing class must provide implementations for all methods
Constructors: An interface cannot have a constructor, while an abstract class can have a constructor.
Properties and fields: Interfaces can only have method signatures and events, while abstract classes can have fields, properties, and instance variables.
In general, you should use an interface if you want to specify a contract that can be implemented by multiple classes, and use an abstract class if you want to create a base class that provides some default behavior.

7. Linkedlist vs list
LinkedList and List are both data structures in C# that can be used to store a sequence of elements. However, they have different underlying implementations and performance characteristics.

Thread safety: LinkedList is not thread-safe, while List is thread-safe. This means that you can safely access a List from multiple threads at the same time, but you cannot safely access a LinkedList from multiple threads at the same time.
Flexibility: LinkedList is more flexible than List. This is because LinkedList can be used to store elements of any type, while List can only be used to store elements of the same type.
Memory usage: LinkedList uses more memory than List. This is because each node in a LinkedList needs to store a reference to the previous and next node.
Insertion and removal: The decision of whether to use LinkedList or List depends on the specific situation. If you need to frequently insert and remove elements from the middle of the list, then you should use LinkedList. If you need to frequently access elements at random indexes, then you should use List.
8. IEnumerable Vs IQueryable
IEnumerable and IQueryable are used for data manipulation in LINQ from the database and collections.

IQueryable exists in the System.Linq Namespace whereas IEnumerable in System.Collection.
IQueryable is suitable for querying data from out-memory (like remote database, service) collections. Whereas IEnumerable is good for In-Memory Collection query.
While querying data from a database, IQueryable executes a “select query” on server-side with all filters. Whereas IEnumerable not run with filters on server side.
IQueryable is beneficial for LINQ to SQL queries. Whereas IEnumerable beneficial for LINQ to Object
IEnumerable doesn’t support lazy loading. Hence not suitable for paging like scenarios. Whereas Iqueryable support lazy loading and suitable for paging like senearios.


9. System.Linq Methods
First() vs First𝐎𝐫𝐃𝐞𝐟𝐚𝐮𝐥𝐭() are both used to return the first element of a sequence.
Single() or SingleOrDefault() methods are also used to return the first element of a sequence, but they throw an exception if the sequence contains more than one element. There is exactly 1 result.
Last() or LastOrDefault() are both used to return the last element of the sequence
The major difference between First and FirstOrDefault is that First() will throw an exception if there is no result data for the supplied criteria whereas FirstOrDefault() will return the default value (null) if there is no result data. It is the same in others.


10. FirstOrDefault() vs SingleOrDefault()
SingleOrDefault() ensures that only one record matches the given condition, meaning it needs to check all rows, even when it finds one at the beginning of the table.
In the other hand, FirstOrDefault() will stop looking for rows after finding a row that matches the criteria.

11.ViewData vs ViewBag vs TempData in MVC
ViewData ,ViewBag and TempData are techniques that allow passing data from controllers to views in ASP.NET MVC. ViewData is a dictionary object that allows passing data as key-value pairs between the controller and the view. On the other hand, ViewBag is a dynamic object that allows passing data as properties from the controller to the view.

In general, ViewBag is easier to use but can be more error-prone than ViewData, as there is no compile-time checking. Therefore, it is recommended to use ViewData for strongly typed data and ViewBag for dynamic data. ViewData and ViewBag pass data to the view that is needed for the current request, but that is not needed for subsequent requests.

Use TempData to pass data to the view that is needed for the next request.


12. What is the concept of anonymous methods in C#?
Anonymous methods in C# are a way to define inline unnamed methods that can be assigned to delegate instances. They provide a short way to create small functions without declaring an entire named method. Anonymous methods use the delegate keyword and do not require a separate method declaration.

13. What are the different types of delegates in C#?
Singlecast Delegates: These delegates reference a single method with a matching signature. When the delegate is invoked, it calls the referenced method.
Multicast Delegates: These delegates can reference multiple methods with a matching signature. When the delegate is invoked, it calls all the referenced methods in the order they were added. Multicast delegates are created using the += or -= operators.
Generic Delegates: These delegates use generic type parameters, allowing them to work with multiple types without casting or boxing/unboxing. C# provides three built-in generic delegates: Func, Action, and Predicate.
14.What is a Nullable type in C# and how do you use it?
In C#, Nullable types are value types which can take null values. This capability is crucial because the value types don’t normally take null values. A Nullable type is declared using the ? symbol after the value type.

For instance, int? is a Nullable type based on the int type. You can assign any value which an int can take, plus an additional null value.

int? number = null;

15.Explain the concept of unmanaged resources in C# and how they can be managed.
Unmanaged resources are those not directly controlled by the .NET runtime, such as file handles, network connections, database connections, and other system resources. Because the .NET runtime’s garbage collector does not manage them, developers must handle such resources explicitly to avoid resource leaks or potential application instability.

To manage unmanaged resources properly, you can:

Implement the IDisposable interface in your class which uses unmanaged resources. The IDisposable interface provides a Dispose method for cleaning up unmanaged resources.
public FileWriter(string fileName)
    {
        fileStream = new FileStream(fileName, FileMode.Create);
    }
    public void Dispose()
    {
        if (fileStream != null)
        {
            fileStream.Dispose();
            fileStream = null;
        }
    }
}
Use the using statement to ensure the Dispose method is called automatically when the object goes out of scope.
using (FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("file.txt"))
{
    // Do some operations
}
In this example, the Dispose method will be called automatically when the using block is exited, ensuring proper cleanup of the unmanaged resources.

16.Explain the Tuple class and its use case in C#.
Tuples are useful in scenarios where you need to return multiple values from a method or store or pass around data without creating a specific data structure.

public Tuple<int, string> GetPersonInfo()
{
    int age = 30;
    string name = "John";
    return Tuple.Create(age, name);
}
var personInfo = GetPersonInfo();
Console.WriteLine($"Name: {personInfo.Item2}, Age: {personInfo.Item1}");
In C# 7.0, tuples were improved with the introduction of ValueTuple. ValueTuples are struct-based (instead of class-based) tuples that allow named elements and other enhancements:

public (int Age, string Name) GetPersonInfo()
{
    int age = 30;
    string name = "John";
    return (age, name);
}
var personInfo = GetPersonInfo();
Console.WriteLine($"Name: {personInfo.Name}, Age: {personInfo.Age}");
17. What is the difference between Dispose() and Finalize() methods?
Garbage collector only claims managed code memory.

There are wo ways to clean the unmanaged resource

1.Automatic way by Finalizer and GC

2.Manual way by Dispose Pattern

Finalize is a destructor and dispose is a function which is implemented via ‘Idisposable’ interface.
Finalize is nondeterministic, since it’s called by garbage collector. Dispose is a function and needs to be called by the client for clean up. In other finalize is automatically called by garbage collector while dispose needs to be called forcefully.
It is recommended to use the dispose() method because it is faster.
Dispose is used to close unmanaged resources stored by an object, like files or streams.
Finalize is used to clear up unmanaged resources owned by the current object before it is destroyed.
18. Managed and Unmanaged Resources in .NET
Code that executes under CLR execution environment is called as managed code. Unmanaged code executes outside CLR boundary. Unmanaged resources are those : file handles, pinned memory, COM objects, database connections etc. GC does not claim memory of unmanaged objects.

19. What is Dependency Injection
“Dependency Injection (DI) it is a technique for managing the dependencies between objects in a flexible and maintainable way.The idea behind Dependency Injection is to pass the dependencies to an object.

Constructor Injection: In the constructor injection, the injector supplies the service (dependency) through the client class constructor.
Property Injection: In the property injection (aka the Setter Injection), the injector supplies the dependency through a public property of the client class.
Method Injection: In this type of injection, the client class implements an interface which declares the method(s) to supply the dependency and the injector uses this interface to supply the dependency to the client class.
20. Async and await keywords in C#.
The async and await keywords in C# are used to write asynchronous code. Asynchronous code is code that can run concurrently with other code, without blocking the current thread. This can be useful for improving the performance and responsiveness of applications.

async: async and await keywords in C# are used to write asynchronous code. Asynchronous code is code that can run concurrently with other code, without blocking the current thread. This can be useful for improving the performance and responsiveness of applications.
await: The await keyword is used to pause the execution of an async method until an awaited task completes. It asynchronously waits for the task to complete and returns the result (if any) without blocking the main execution thread. The await keyword can only be used inside an async method.
We can use async and await keywords in C# to implement async programming in this easy way.

How do you handle exceptions globally in an ASP.NET Core Web API project?
Answer
Global exception handling in ASP.NET Core can be achieved using middleware. The ideal place to handle exceptions is in the middleware pipeline so that it is separate from your application logic, and can trap any unhandled exceptions.

One of the most effective ways is to use the built-in UseExceptionHandler middleware which captures synchronous and asynchronous exceptions. With this middleware, you can redirect to an error handling route or render an error response directly.

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    if (env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
    }
    else
    {
        app.UseExceptionHandler("/api/Error");
    }

    //... rest of the middleware
}
In the above code, when an exception is raised it is handled by the “/api/Error” route.

Another method of handling global exceptions is using UseDeveloperExceptionPage middleware which provides detailed exception information in the local development environment.


How to do database migrations in Entity Framework Core?
Answer
Entity Framework Core (EF Core) includes a feature called Migrations that allows you to make changes to your model and then propagate those changes to your database schema. Here’s a basic overview of performing a migration:

1. Install the necessary packages: EF Core requires certain NuGet packages to perform migrations. Make sure you have the basic Entity Framework Core and EF Core tools packages installed in your project.

2. Create a new Migration: Use the Add-Migration command and provide a name for your migration. This creates a new class in your Migrations folder that contains the changes to be made to the database schema.

Add-Migration MyFirstMigration
3. Update the database: Use the Update-Database command. This applies any pending migrations on the database. EF Core creates the database if it does not exist.

Update-Database
You may opt to provide a specific migration name if you want to update the database to a specific migration rather than the latest.

Remember to treat migrations as a part of your codebase. They need to be kept under source control and applied as part of your deployment process. Well-managed migrations are key to dealing with evolving database schemas.

How is routing implemented in ASP.NET Core MVC compared to ASP.NET MVC?
Answer
There are several differences in how routing is handled in ASP.NET Core MVC compared to ASP.NET MVC.

In ASP.NET MVC, routing was handled through a central RouteConfig file that includes rules for each controller and action method. These routing rules can be either attribute-based or convention-based.
On the other hand, ASP.NET Core MVC uses middleware for routing. It provides two types of routing methodologies – convention-based routing and attribute routing. All the routing information is configured in the Startup.cs file.
In ASP.NET Core MVC, we also have a new feature, Routing to Razor Pages. Razor Pages are a new aspect of ASP.NET Core MVC that allow you to create page-based programming model.
Additionally, ASP.NET Core MVC supports route constraints, which weren’t available in ASP.NET MVC. Route constraints let you restrict how the parameters in the route template are matched.
What are some of the best techniques for optimizing performance in .NET Core applications?
Answer
Optimizing performance in .NET Core applications could involve several techniques:

Caching: It’s about storing data somewhere for future use to speed up the application. .NET Core provides support for several different types of caching including in-memory caching, distributed caching, and response caching.
Asynchronous Programming: Use the async and await keywords to write asynchronous code that’s easier to read, write and manage.
Pooling: Techniques such as Object Pooling or Connection Pooling can be used to recycle objects or connections instead of creating and destroying them frequently.
Optimization of Data Access: Minimize the amount of data that you send over the network and reduce the number of server round trips.
Use of Middleware: Middleware components are used to handle requests and responses. Ensure that unnecessary middleware components are not registered.

Can you explain some possible strategies for managing session state in a distributed .NET Core application?
Answer
Managing session state in a distributed .NET Core application generally involves either a server-side or client-side session management approach.

Server-side session management: It store session data on the server. This strategy involves storing the session state in a database or in-memory data store like Redis. This allows applications running on multiple servers to have access to the shared session data.
Client-side session management: In this strategy, the session state is stored in a client side, usually in cookies or in local storage. This strategy eliminates the need to store session data on the server, which can be especially useful in applications with a large number of users.
Distributed Cache Session Management: ASP.NET Core provides IDistributedCache interface that you can use to store your session state.
Remember to always secure session data, especially when incorporating client-side session management strategies.


3. How do you explain what a service lifetime is?
An interviewer might ask this question to see if you understand the various lifetimes of registered services in .NET Core frameworks. A sound answer outlines the three different service lifetimes with specific explanations of each.

Example: "A service lifetime refers to how long an object lives after being created. The three typical lifetimes are transient, scoped and singleton. Transient lifetimes are ideal for stateless and lightweight services because they get created each time the service container gets used. Scoped lifetimes happen once every connection. Singleton lifetimes happen when initially created and again with each subsequent request from the service container."

6. Share a time you prioritised an IT task over something else and why.
Behavioral questions can help interviewers understand how you might react during a specific situation. Questions like this often give insight into your problem-solving abilities, time management skills and creative thinking. Consider giving an answer that involved a challenging deadline, positive results or potentially unpopular decision to help show how you manage stressful situations.

Example: "My team worked on an application and had a presentation to senior executives. Marketing colleagues wanted updated statistics and project reports from our department, but a team member told me about a system bug during testing runs that affected the show-and-tell portion of the presentation. Though the deadline to share materials with the marketing team drew near, I communicated our troubleshooting took priority and pushed the submission deadline. We addressed the glitch the same day and sent our updated report the next morning. The marketing team appreciated my honesty and ultimately included the updated fix in their presentation to leaders."

7. What are some challenges you face while working with .NET Core?
A question about challenges can show an interviewer how you handle work situations, along with giving insight into your analytical and critical thinking skills. Try focusing your answer on specific situations from your past work experience or projects and describe how you overcame the challenges to best display your tenacity and ability to move past obstacles. Consider using the STAR method of providing answers to situational questions.

Example: "When I first became familiar with .NET Core, I often experienced server overloads and database issues when developing an application for my primary client. I noticed the landing pages worked, though they performed slowly with a lag time that might deter users. I connected with database administrators to monitor settings that allowed us to gain better performance while we further developed the app."

8. What is an action method?
Interviewers often seek to know you have a broad depth and understanding of industry terms, processes and practices. This question can help show your specific knowledge of IT concepts. Consider providing a concise answer that confidently addresses the question.

Example: "An action method executes activity when an HTTP request takes place. It is a controller class that has specific parameters. For example, action method must be public, rather than protected or private. It cannot get overloaded and it cannot be a static method."

9. How would you describe what a cookie is to someone not technologically savvy?
This question can showcase your ability to explain complex processes in simple ways. Because communication is an essential skill in nearly every industry, an interviewer might glean insight into your oral and written communication skills. Consider using straightforward descriptions that someone outside of the IT industry can understand when forming your answer.

Example: "A cookie is a small amount of data stored on your computer, mobile or other devices when you access a website. When you go back to the website again, it knows you have visited before. Cookies allow companies to tailor a website, promotion or offer to you specifically because they already know a bit about you as a consumer. Nearly all sites use cookies and they are relatively safe from viruses and malware."

10. What are caching and response caching in .NET Core?
An interviewer might ask this question to establish your awareness between various caching types and other software development aspects. Technical questions often require a precise response, so consider reviewing primary concepts used in the IT industry and .NET Core specifically to best be prepared.

Example: "Caching is a process that reduces the number of calls to the data source, improving the application's performance and scalability. It essentially stores a copy of the data instead of generating it each time you access the original source. For example, if you visit a specific website or app frequently, some data already on your device let the page run faster, giving you a better user experience. For data that frequently changes, response caching sets parameters for the headers that control caching."

14. How can you improve Stored Procedure Performance?

You should focus on certain points for your Stored Procedure performance as below.

Use Proper indexing on tables.
Set NOCount ON|OFF - it will control some messages like - after running some update query you see messages - '0 rows affected'.
Use Select count(1) instead of count(*) for count function.
do not use prefix 'SP' while creating stored procedures as default system stored procedures also starts with prefix 'SP'.
Whenever it's required fetch data from the table with 'NOLOCK' keyword WITH(NOLOCK).
Set ANSI_Nulls ON|OFF- When it's ON it means a select statement will return zero results even if there are null values in the column. When It's OFF means select statement will return the corresponding rows with null values in columns. When you are setting it OFF means comparison operators do not follow ISO standards.
Set Quoted_Identifier ON|OFF - When it's ON means identifiers are delimited by double quotes and literals are delimited by single quotes. But when it's OFF means identifiers can not be delimited by quotation.

1. How to implement asynchronous programming?
Asynchronous programming in .NET is usually implemented using the async and await keywords. Asynchronous programming is commonly used for I/O bound operations, such as file access, database queries, and network communication.

Asynchronous programming is particularly useful in web application development to prevent main-thread blocking while performing synchronous I/O operations.

2. What do you know about dependency injection?
Dependency Injection is the implementation of Inversion of Control, where a class no longer initializes its dependencies but instead accepts them through constructors or properties.

Three commonly used service lifetimes are Singleton, Scoped, and Transient.

Singleton: The instance is created once and used throughout the application's runtime.
Scoped: Created a new one for each scope, usually each request in the web application.
Transient: Created every time the dependency is called.
Dependency injection enhances modularity and flexibility and simplifies unit testing by replacing actual dependencies with mockups.

3. Can you explain the SOLID principles?
The SOLID principles provide five guidelines for developing code that is easy to maintain and extend.

Single Responsibility: Each class can only have one responsibility.
Open/Closed: Each class must be open for extension and closed for modification.
Liskov Substitution: The parent class must be able to be replaced by any derived class without causing errors in the program.
Interface Segregation: Each class should only implement the interfaces that will actually be used.
Dependency Inversion: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both must rely on abstractions.
4. What do you know about unit testing?
Unit testing is used to ensure application logic runs according to specifications. We can use unit testing frameworks such as NUnit or xUnit. Mocking libraries such as Moq can be used to create mock objects.

The code coverage of the unit tests must reach the specified percentage. The ideal value for code coverage is around 80%. We can use tools such as SonarCube or JetBrains dotCover to measure the code coverage.

5. How do you implement a locking mechanism?
Locking mechanisms are important for managing resources accessed together in multithreading to avoid race conditions and deadlocks. Locking mechanisms can be implemented using. lock, Monitor, Mutex, and Semaphore.

6. What do you know about LINQ?
LINQ (Language-Integrated Query) is a feature that allows writing queries to data sources in a declarative and consistent way. LINQ can be used to perform queries to memory (lists or arrays), databases, and XML.

We can apply LINQ to query the database using an ORM such as Entity Framework. Each LINQ query will be converted into an SQL query and executed on the database.

7. How do you troubleshoot?
The troubleshooting process can be done using the Visual Studio debugger to check variable values and program execution flow. Utilizing logging functionality is beneficial in identifying and resolving errors that may arise while troubleshooting.

For performance-related problems, we can use profiling tools such as Visual Studio Diagnostic Tools or JetBrains dotTrace.
