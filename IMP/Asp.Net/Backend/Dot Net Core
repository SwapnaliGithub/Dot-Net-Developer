How to Troubleshoot Performance Bottlenecks in .NET Core Application
Hide answer

Troubleshooting performance bottlenecks in a .NET Core application can be a challenging task, but here are a few best practices for troubleshooting performance bottlenecks:

Use Profiling Tools
Use profiling tools, such as the built-in .NET Core profiler or third-party tools like ANTS Performance Profiler or JetBrains dotTrace, to identify performance bottlenecks in your application. Profiling tools can provide detailed information about the performance of your application, such as the time spent in specific methods and the number of allocations.

Use Logging and Monitoring
Use logging and monitoring to track the performance of your application. This can help you identify performance bottlenecks and understand how they are impacting your application.

Use Performance Counters
Use performance counters to track the performance of specific aspects of your application, such as memory usage, CPU usage, and network traffic. Performance counters can help you identify performance bottlenecks and understand how they are impacting your application.


How to Optimize the Performance of a .NET Core Application
Hide answer

There are several ways to optimize the performance of a .NET Core application. Here are a few best practices:

Use the Right Data Types and Collections
Choosing the right data types and collections for your application can have a big impact on performance. For example, using a Dictionary instead of a List for lookups can be much faster. Also, using struct instead of class for small, simple types can also improve performance, because it eliminates the overhead of allocating and garbage collecting an object.

Avoid Allocating Unnecessary Objects
Allocating too many objects can cause performance issues, because the garbage collector has to work harder to clean them up. Try to reuse objects instead of creating new ones, and avoid using new unnecessarily.

Use Asynchronous Programming
Asynchronous programming can help improve the performance of your application by allowing it to do multiple things at the same time. For example, instead of blocking a thread while waiting for a slow operation to complete, you can use asynchronous programming to allow the thread to continue working on other tasks.

Use Caching
Caching can be a powerful tool for improving performance, by storing frequently-used data in memory so that it can be quickly retrieved. Redis, In-Memory caching, and Distributed caching are a few caching options that are available in .NET Core.

Use Profiling and Debugging Tools
There are many profiling and debugging tools available that can help you identify performance bottlenecks in your application. Some examples include:

The dotnet-trace command-line tool for tracing events in your application
The dotnet-counters command-line tool for monitoring performance counters
The dotnet-dump command-line tool for creating memory dumps of your application
The PerfView tool for analyzing performance data
Optimize Database Queries
If your application uses a database, optimizing the database queries is a must. Make sure that your queries are properly indexed, and avoid using N+1 queries. Use EF Core's Include method to eager load related entities, and use AsNoTracking method to avoid tracking the entities.

Use the Latest Version of .NET Core
.NET Core is constantly being improved and optimized, so make sure you are using the latest version of the framework. Updating to the latest version can bring performance improvements and new features that can help you optimize your application.

It's worth noting that this list is not exhaustive and there might be other ways to optimize the performance of your application, depending on the specifics of the application. Also, these practices should be followed and tested in a development environment before applying them to production.

What caching options are available in .NET Core and when should they be used?
Hide answer

.NET Core provides several caching options that can be used to improve the performance of your application. Here are a few of the most common caching options available in .NET Core:

In-Memory Caching
In-memory caching stores data in the application's memory. This is the simplest caching option, and it can be useful for small, simple applications. However, because the data is stored in memory, it will be lost when the application is restarted.

Distributed Caching
Distributed caching stores data in a distributed cache that can be shared across multiple servers. This can be useful for large, high-traffic applications that need to scale horizontally. Some popular distributed caching options include Redis and NCache.

SQL Server Caching
SQL Server caching stores data in a SQL Server database. This can be useful for applications that need to store data that needs to be persisted across restarts.

Output Caching
Output caching is used to cache the output of a controller action, so that the same output does not need to be generated multiple times. This can be useful for high-traffic applications where the output of a specific action does not change frequently.

File-Based Caching
File-based caching stores data in a file. This can be useful for applications that need to store data that needs to be persisted across restarts.

When choosing a caching option, it's important to consider the specific needs of your application. For example, if your application needs to store large amounts of data that will be frequently accessed, a distributed cache like Redis or NCache might be the best option. On the other hand, if your application only needs to store small amounts of data that will be accessed infrequently, an in-memory cache might be sufficient.

It's also worth noting that caching can have a significant impact on the performance of your application, but it can also add complexity to your application. Therefore, it's important to use caching judiciously and to monitor the performance of your application to ensure that caching is actually improving performance.


Use Tracing
Use tracing to track the execution of your application. Tracing can help you understand how different parts of your application are interacting and identify performance bottlenecks.

Use Application Insights
Use Application Insights to monitor the performance of your application in production. Application Insights can provide detailed information about the performance of your application, such as the number of requests, response times, and exceptions.

It's worth noting that this list is not exhaustive and there might be other ways to troubleshoot performance bottlenecks in a .NET Core application, depending on the specifics of the application. Also, it's important to keep in mind that troubleshooting performance bottlenecks can be a complex process and it may require multiple approaches to identify and resolve the issue.



Can you explain the concept of Lazy Loading and Eager Loading in Entity Framework Core?
In Entity Framework Core, Lazy Loading and Eager Loading are techniques used to load related data. Lazy loading is a technique where the related data is not loaded until it is explicitly accessed and it is enabled by default. Eager loading is a technique where the related data is loaded along with the main object when it is retrieved from the database. It can be done by using the Include method in a query. Eager loading is more efficient when you know that you will need the related data, and you will be using it right away, whereas Lazy loading is useful when you may or may not need the related data, and you want to avoid loading unnecessary data in memory.

Can you explain the concept of Inversion of Control in .NET Core?
Hide answer

Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design principle that allows the dependencies of a class to be passed to it, rather than the class instantiating them itself. This allows for more flexibility and decoupling of the different components of the application.

In .NET Core, IoC can be implemented using a Dependency Injection (DI) container. A DI container is a library that manages the creation and lifetime of objects, and resolves their dependencies. This allows the application to be more loosely coupled, making it easier to test and maintain.

Implementing IoC in .NET Core
To implement IoC in a .NET Core application, you can use a DI container such as Autofac or Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection. These containers allow you to register the types that the application needs and configure how their dependencies are resolved.

For example, using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection:


public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddTransient<IPersonRepository, PersonRepository>();
    }
}
In this example, the IPersonRepository interface is registered with the PersonRepository class as its implementation. The AddTransient method specifies that a new instance of PersonRepository should be created each time it is requested.

You can then use the DI container to resolve the dependencies of your classes. In the constructor of your classes, you can specify the dependencies that the class needs and the DI container will instantiate them and pass them to the class.

For example,


public class PersonService
{
    private readonly IPersonRepository _personRepository;

    public PersonService(IPersonRepository personRepository)
    {
        _personRepository = personRepository;
    }

    public Person GetById(int id)
    {
        return _personRepository.GetById(id);
    }
}
In this example, the PersonService class has a dependency on the IPersonRepository interface, which is passed to it through the constructor.

Conclusion
Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design principle that allows the dependencies of a class to be passed to it, rather than the class instantiating them itself. In .NET Core, IoC can be implemented using a Dependency Injection (DI) container such as Autofac or Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection. Using a DI container allows the application to be more loosely coupled, making it easier to test and maintain. It also allows for more flexibility and decoupling of the different components of the application.

Design Patterns in .NET Core
Design patterns are reusable solutions to common programming problems. They are not specific to any particular programming language or framework and can be applied in various situations. In .NET Core, design patterns can be implemented using the core language features of C# such as classes, interfaces, and delegates. Additionally, the framework provides several built-in features such as dependency injection and configuration that can help with the implementation of design patterns. Understanding and using design patterns in .NET Core can help to improve the design and structure of your code, making it more maintainable, scalable and testable.


SOLID principles in .NET Core
Hide answer

SOLID is an acronym that stands for five design principles for writing maintainable and scalable software. They are:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one responsibility. This helps to keep the code maintainable and easy to understand.

Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
The Open-Closed Principle states that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that a class should be designed in such a way that new functionality can be added without modifying existing code. This can be achieved through the use of interfaces and abstract classes.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without altering the correctness of the program. This principle helps to ensure that subclasses are substitutable for their superclasses and that the code is more robust.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
The Interface Segregation Principle states that a class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use. This helps to keep the interfaces small and focused, and makes it easier to understand the relationships between classes.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions. This helps to decouple the code and makes it more flexible and easier to maintain.

Implementing SOLID principles in .NET Core
SOLID principles can be implemented in a .NET Core application through the use of good object-oriented design and design patterns such as the Dependency Injection pattern. For example, the use of interfaces and dependency injection can help to decouple the code and make it more flexible and maintainable. Additionally, using design patterns such as the Repository pattern and the Mediator pattern can help to separate the concerns of the application and make it easier to apply the SOLID principles.

Conclusion
SOLID is an acronym that stands for five design principles for writing maintainable and scalable software. These principles include the Single Responsibility Principle, the Open-Closed Principle, the Liskov Substitution Principle, the Interface Segregation Principle, and the Dependency Inversion Principle. Implementing these principles in a .NET Core application can help to make the code more flexible and maintainable.

Can you explain the concept of JWT in .NET Core?
Hide answer

JWT (JSON Web Token) is an open standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. JWTs are often used to authenticate and authorize users in a web application. A JWT typically contains a header, a payload, and a signature.

In .NET Core, JWT authentication can be implemented using the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer package, which provides a middleware that can validate JWTs. Here is an example of how to configure JWT authentication in a .NET Core web application:


public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
        .AddJwtBearer(options =>
        {
            options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
            {
                ValidateIssuer = true,
                ValidateAudience = true,
                ValidateLifetime = true,
                ValidateIssuerSigningKey = true,
                ValidIssuer = Configuration["Jwt:Issuer"],
                ValidAudience = Configuration["Jwt:Audience"],
                IssuerSigningKey = new SymmetricSecurityKey(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(Configuration["Jwt:Key"]))
            };
        });
}
In this example, the AddAuthentication and AddJwtBearer methods are used to add the JWT bearer authentication middleware to the services collection. The TokenValidationParameters class is used to configure the validation of the JWT, including the issuer, audience, lifetime, and signing key.

Once JWT authentication is configured, it can be used to protect routes or controllers in the application by adding the [Authorize] attribute:


[Authorize]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class ValuesController : Controller
{
    // ...
}
In this example, the ValuesController is protected by the JWT authentication, and a valid JWT is required to access any of the actions in this controller.

It's important to keep in mind that JWT is a stateless authentication mechanism, which means the server doesn't store any information about the client's state. This can be seen as a pro or con depending on the use case and the requirements of the application.

In summary, JWT is a widely used standard for securely transmitting information


Can you explain the concept of Scaffolding in .NET Core?
Hide answer

Scaffolding is a feature of .NET Core that allows developers to automatically generate the initial code for a web application based on a database schema or a data model. The generated code includes controllers, views, and a data access layer that can be used to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data.

Scaffolding can be performed using the dotnet command-line tool and the Scaffold-DbContext command. The command takes several options such as the connection string, the provider (e.g. SQL Server, MySQL, etc.), and the output directory. Here is an example of how to scaffold a web application using the Scaffold-DbContext command:


dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold "Server=localhost;Database=Northwind;Trusted_Connection=True;" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -o Models
In this example, the Scaffold-DbContext command is used to scaffold a web application based on the Northwind database, using the SQL Server provider, and the generated code is saved in the Models directory.

Scaffolding can save a lot of time and effort when building a new web application, especially when working with a pre-existing database. However, it's important to keep in mind that the generated code should be reviewed and customized as needed, since it's not always going to be perfect for every use case. Also, Scaffolding is mainly used for Code-First approach, if you are using Database-First approach then you have to use reverse engineering to get your models and context.

It's also important to note that scaffolding is not limited to web applications and can also be used to generate code for other types of projects, such as console applications and libraries.

Can you explain the concept of LINQ in .NET Core?
Hide answer

LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is a powerful feature of C# and .NET that allows you to perform complex queries and operations on data, such as filtering, ordering, and grouping, using a simple and intuitive syntax. LINQ can be used to query data from a variety of sources, including in-memory collections, databases, and XML documents.

LINQ is based on two main concepts: extension methods and lambda expressions. Extension methods are methods that can be called on an instance of a class, as if they were an instance method. Lambda expressions are a way to define small, anonymous functions that can be passed as arguments to methods.

Here is an example of how to use LINQ to query a collection of objects:


var numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };

// Use LINQ to filter the numbers that are greater than 3
var filteredNumbers = numbers.Where(n => n > 3);

// Use LINQ to order the filtered numbers in descending order
var orderedNumbers = filteredNumbers.OrderByDescending(n => n);

foreach (var n in orderedNumbers) {
    Console.WriteLine(n);
}
In this example, the Where and OrderByDescending methods are extension methods that are called on the numbers collection. The n => n > 3 and n => n lambda expressions are used to define the filtering and ordering conditions, respectively.

LINQ can also be used to query data from a database using the LINQ to SQL or LINQ to Entities providers. Here is an example of how to use LINQ to query data from a database:


using (var db = new NorthwindContext()) {
    // Use LINQ to query the customers who live in London
    var customers = db.Customers
        .Where(c => c.City == "London")
        .Select(c => new { c.ContactName, c.CompanyName });

    foreach (var customer in customers) {
        Console.WriteLine(customer.ContactName + " - " + customer.CompanyName);
    }
}
In this example, the Where and Select methods are used to query the customers who live in London and select the contact name and company name of each customer.

LINQ is a powerful and versatile feature that allows developers to write expressive, readable and maintainable code. It's widely used in different scenarios where data querying is required, and it's an important feature that any .NET developer should master.

Can you explain the concept of Entities Framework Core in .NET Core?
Hide answer

Entity Framework Core (EF Core) is a lightweight, extensible, and cross-platform version of the popular Entity Framework data access technology for .NET. It is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool that allows you to interact with databases using .NET objects, eliminating the need to write raw SQL code. EF Core supports a variety of data stores such as SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite.

EF Core provides a way to define the model of your data using C# classes called "entities", and then it automatically generates the necessary SQL code to create and maintain the corresponding database tables.

Here is an example of how to define an entity class and a context class in EF Core:


public class MyEntity {
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

public class MyContext : DbContext {
    public DbSet<MyEntity> MyEntities { get; set; }

    protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder) {
        optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer("Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=mydb;Trusted_Connection=True;");
    }
}
In this example, the MyEntity class is a simple POCO (Plain Old CLR Object) class that represents a table in the database and the MyContext class is a context class that derives from DbContext and is used to interact with the database. The DbSet<MyEntity> property is used to represent the corresponding table in the database. The OnConfiguring method is used to specify the database connection string.

EF Core provides a variety of ways to interact with the data, such as LINQ, fluent API, and raw SQL. You can use EF Core to query, insert, update and delete data, as well as track changes and perform migrations.

It's important to note that EF Core is a powerful tool that can help to simplify data access and improve the maintainability of your application, but it also adds complexity and it's essential to properly design your model and understand the underlying SQL queries being generated to avoid performance issues and unexpected results. Additionally, it's important to use EF Core in a way that is consistent with the principles of the ORM and to be aware of its limitations and best practices.

How do you implement data validation in a .NET Core application?
Hide answer

Data validation is the process of ensuring that the data received by the application is valid and conforms to the expected format and constraints. In .NET Core, data validation can be implemented using the built-in data annotation attributes or by creating custom validation logic.

Data annotation attributes are a set of predefined attributes that can be applied to model properties to specify validation rules. For example, the [Required] attribute can be used to indicate that a property is required, and the [StringLength] attribute can be used to specify a maximum length for a string property.

Here is an example of how to use data annotation attributes to validate a model:


public class MyModel {
    [Required]
    public string Name { get; set; }

    [Range(1, 100)]
    public int Age { get; set; }

    [EmailAddress]
    public string Email { get; set; }
}
In this example, the Name property is marked as required, the Age property is restricted to a range between 1 and 100, and the Email property is restricted to a valid email format.

In addition to data annotations, you can also use the built-in ModelState object to validate the data on the server side. The ModelState object contains the validation errors for the model and can be used to check if the model is valid before performing any further processing.

Here is an example of how to use the ModelState object to validate a model:


[HttpPost]
public IActionResult Create([FromBody] MyModel model) {
    if (!ModelState.IsValid) {
        return BadRequest(ModelState);
    }
    //Process the model
}
In this example, the ModelState.IsValid property is used to check if the model is valid and return a BadRequest response with the validation errors if it is not.

In addition to built-in validation, you can also use custom validation logic in a .NET Core application by creating a custom validation attribute. Custom validation attributes allow you to perform complex validation logic and can be used to validate the data in a specific way.

It's important to note that data validation is an important aspect of security and should be implemented at multiple levels in the application to ensure that the data received is both accurate and secure.


How do you implement Caching in a .NET Core application?
Hide answer

Caching is a technique for improving the performance of a web application by storing frequently-used data in memory so that it can be quickly retrieved without having to be recalculated or fetched from a database.

In .NET Core, there are several caching options available, such as in-memory caching, distributed caching, and response caching.


Can you explain the concept of Identity in .NET Core?
Hide answer

Identity is a feature of ASP.NET Core that provides a way to handle authentication and authorization for web applications. It allows you to easily add support for user registration, login, and password management to your application.

In .NET Core, identity is implemented using the Identity library, which provides a set of classes and interfaces for handling user identities and roles.


Can you explain the concept of Razor Pages in .NET Core?
Hide answer

Razor Pages is a new feature in ASP.NET Core that provides an alternative way to build web applications using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. It provides a simple and easy-to-use approach for building web pages, and is especially useful for small to medium-sized applications or for developers who are new to ASP.NET Core.

Razor Pages are built around the concept of Pages, which are classes that handle web requests and return the appropriate views or data. Each page is represented by a Razor template file, which contains the HTML markup and the C# code that renders the page.

Here is an example of a Razor Page:


public class IndexModel : PageModel {
    public void OnGet() {
        // code to handle the GET request
    }

    public void OnPost() {
        // code to handle the POST request
    }
}
In this example, the IndexModel class is a Razor Page that handles GET and POST requests. It contains two methods, OnGet and OnPost, which are executed when the page is requested using the GET and POST methods, respectively.

Razor Pages also provide built-in support for model binding and validation, making it easy to handle user input and respond with the appropriate data or views.

Razor Pages can be used in conjunction with Controllers and Razor views, making it easy to use the best of both worlds.

It's important to note that Razor Pages are best suited for smaller applications with simple routing and simple pages with minimal business logic. If your application is complex and you have a lot of business logic that needs to be shared across multiple pages, it might be better to use controllers and views as they offer more flexibility.


How do you implement exception handling in a .NET Core application?
Hide answer

In .NET Core, exception handling is implemented using try-catch blocks or using global exception handlers.

Here is an example of how to use a try-catch block to handle an exception:


try {
    // code that may throw an exception
} catch (Exception ex) {
    // code to handle the exception
}
In this example, the code inside the try block may throw an exception, and the code inside the catch block will be executed if an exception is thrown.

You can also use the finally block to execute code that should always be executed, whether an exception is thrown or not.

Additionally, you can also use global exception handlers to handle exceptions that are not caught by try-catch blocks.

Here is an example of how to use a global exception handler in a .NET Core application:


app.UseExceptionHandler("/error");
In this example, the UseExceptionHandler method is used to configure the application to handle exceptions by redirecting the user to the "/error" page.

It's important to keep in mind that exception handling should be used sparingly and only to handle exceptional situations. It's best to use a structured approach to handling errors, such as using return codes or status codes, instead of relying on exception handling.

Can you explain the difference between a synchronous and asynchronous method in .NET Core?
Hide answer

In .NET Core, a synchronous method is a method that runs to completion before returning control to the calling code. Synchronous methods block the execution of the calling thread until they are finished.

Here is an example of a synchronous method:


public int AddNumbers(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
On the other hand, an asynchronous method is a method that returns control to the calling code before it is finished. Asynchronous methods do not block the execution of the calling thread, and they can be used to perform long-running tasks, such as I/O operations or network requests, without blocking the main thread.

Here is an example of an asynchronous method:


public async Task<int> AddNumbersAsync(int a, int b) {
    await Task.Delay(1000);
    return a + b;
}
The key difference between synchronous and asynchronous methods is the way they handle concurrency. Synchronous methods block the calling thread, while asynchronous methods do not.

In .NET Core, asynchronous methods are marked with the async keyword and return a task or a Task<T> where T is the type of the result. To await the completion of an asynchronous method, you use the await keyword.

It's important to note that using asynchronous methods does not necessarily make your application faster. However, it can improve the responsiveness and scalability of your application by allowing other code to execute while a long-running task is being executed.


How do you implement security in a .NET Core web application?
Hide answer

Implementing security in a .NET Core web application is an important aspect of building a secure and robust application. There are several built-in features and tools that can be used to secure a .NET Core web application.

Here are a few examples of how to implement security in a .NET Core web application:

Authentication and Authorization: You can use the built-in Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication package to implement various authentication schemes such as cookies, OpenID Connect, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT). You can also use the built-in Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization package to implement role-based and claim-based authorization.
HTTPS: You can use the built-in Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel package to configure your application to use HTTPS.
CORS: You can use the built-in Microsoft.AspNetCore.Cors package to configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers to control which domains are allowed to make cross-origin requests to your application.
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): You can use the built-in Microsoft.AspNetCore.Antiforgery package to protect your application from CSRF attacks.
SQL Injection: You can use the built-in Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore package to implement parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): You can use the built-in Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ViewFeatures package to implement encoding and validation to prevent XSS attacks.
It's important to keep in mind that security is a complex and ever-changing field and a single measure is not enough to protect an application. It's important to keep your application and dependencies up-to-date and to use a variety of security measures to protect your application.

How do you handle configurat

Can you explain the concept of Middleware in .NET Core?
Hide answer

In .NET Core, middleware is a component that sits between the web server and the application, and is responsible for handling the incoming HTTP request and generating the appropriate response. Middleware is added to the application pipeline in the Startup.cs file and is executed in the order it is added.

Here is an example of how to add middleware to the pipeline in the Startup.cs file:


public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    app.UseMiddleware<MyMiddleware>();
    app.UseRouting();
    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapGet("/", async context =>
        {
            await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello World!");
        });
    });
}
This code adds the MyMiddleware class to the pipeline and it will be executed before the routing middleware.

Middleware can be used to perform various tasks, such as handling requests and generating responses, authenticating and authorizing requests, and caching responses. You can use the built-in middleware or create your own custom middleware.

Middleware allows for a modular and flexible approach to handling requests and generating responses in .NET Core applications.

Can you explain the concept of Dependency Injection in .NET Core?
Hide answer

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that allows for the removal of hard-coded dependencies and makes it possible to change them, whether at run-time or compile-time. In .NET Core, the built-in Dependency Injection (DI) system allows for the creation of instances of classes and their dependencies to be handled automatically by the framework.

Here is an example of how to register a service and its implementation with the built-in DI container in .NET Core:


services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>();
This code tells the DI container to create a new instance of MyService whenever an instance of IMyService is needed.

In a constructor of a class, you can use the IMyService interface as a parameter. The DI container will then automatically inject the correct implementation.


public class MyController {
    private readonly IMyService _myService;
    public MyController(IMyService myService) {
        _myService = myService;

How do you handle exceptions globally in an ASP.NET Core Web API project?
Answer
Global exception handling in ASP.NET Core can be achieved using middleware. The ideal place to handle exceptions is in the middleware pipeline so that it is separate from your application logic, and can trap any unhandled exceptions.

One of the most effective ways is to use the built-in UseExceptionHandler middleware which captures synchronous and asynchronous exceptions. With this middleware, you can redirect to an error handling route or render an error response directly.

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    if (env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
    }
    else
    {
        app.UseExceptionHandler("/api/Error");
    }

    //... rest of the middleware
}
In the above code, when an exception is raised it is handled by the “/api/Error” route.

Another method of handling global exceptions is using UseDeveloperExceptionPage middleware which provides detailed exception information in the local development environment.


How to do database migrations in Entity Framework Core?
Answer
Entity Framework Core (EF Core) includes a feature called Migrations that allows you to make changes to your model and then propagate those changes to your database schema. Here’s a basic overview of performing a migration:

1. Install the necessary packages: EF Core requires certain NuGet packages to perform migrations. Make sure you have the basic Entity Framework Core and EF Core tools packages installed in your project.

2. Create a new Migration: Use the Add-Migration command and provide a name for your migration. This creates a new class in your Migrations folder that contains the changes to be made to the database schema.

Add-Migration MyFirstMigration
3. Update the database: Use the Update-Database command. This applies any pending migrations on the database. EF Core creates the database if it does not exist.

Update-Database
You may opt to provide a specific migration name if you want to update the database to a specific migration rather than the latest.

Remember to treat migrations as a part of your codebase. They need to be kept under source control and applied as part of your deployment process. Well-managed migrations are key to dealing with evolving database schemas.

How is routing implemented in ASP.NET Core MVC compared to ASP.NET MVC?
Answer
There are several differences in how routing is handled in ASP.NET Core MVC compared to ASP.NET MVC.

In ASP.NET MVC, routing was handled through a central RouteConfig file that includes rules for each controller and action method. These routing rules can be either attribute-based or convention-based.
On the other hand, ASP.NET Core MVC uses middleware for routing. It provides two types of routing methodologies – convention-based routing and attribute routing. All the routing information is configured in the Startup.cs file.
In ASP.NET Core MVC, we also have a new feature, Routing to Razor Pages. Razor Pages are a new aspect of ASP.NET Core MVC that allow you to create page-based programming model.
Additionally, ASP.NET Core MVC supports route constraints, which weren’t available in ASP.NET MVC. Route constraints let you restrict how the parameters in the route template are matched.
What are some of the best techniques for optimizing performance in .NET Core applications?
Answer
Optimizing performance in .NET Core applications could involve several techniques:

Caching: It’s about storing data somewhere for future use to speed up the application. .NET Core provides support for several different types of caching including in-memory caching, distributed caching, and response caching.
Asynchronous Programming: Use the async and await keywords to write asynchronous code that’s easier to read, write and manage.
Pooling: Techniques such as Object Pooling or Connection Pooling can be used to recycle objects or connections instead of creating and destroying them frequently.
Optimization of Data Access: Minimize the amount of data that you send over the network and reduce the number of server round trips.
Use of Middleware: Middleware components are used to handle requests and responses. Ensure that unnecessary middleware components are not registered.

Can you explain some possible strategies for managing session state in a distributed .NET Core application?
Answer
Managing session state in a distributed .NET Core application generally involves either a server-side or client-side session management approach.

Server-side session management: It store session data on the server. This strategy involves storing the session state in a database or in-memory data store like Redis. This allows applications running on multiple servers to have access to the shared session data.
Client-side session management: In this strategy, the session state is stored in a client side, usually in cookies or in local storage. This strategy eliminates the need to store session data on the server, which can be especially useful in applications with a large number of users.
Distributed Cache Session Management: ASP.NET Core provides IDistributedCache interface that you can use to store your session state.
Remember to always secure session data, especially when incorporating client-side session management strategies.


3. How do you explain what a service lifetime is?
An interviewer might ask this question to see if you understand the various lifetimes of registered services in .NET Core frameworks. A sound answer outlines the three different service lifetimes with specific explanations of each.

Example: "A service lifetime refers to how long an object lives after being created. The three typical lifetimes are transient, scoped and singleton. Transient lifetimes are ideal for stateless and lightweight services because they get created each time the service container gets used. Scoped lifetimes happen once every connection. Singleton lifetimes happen when initially created and again with each subsequent request from the service container."

6. Share a time you prioritised an IT task over something else and why.
Behavioral questions can help interviewers understand how you might react during a specific situation. Questions like this often give insight into your problem-solving abilities, time management skills and creative thinking. Consider giving an answer that involved a challenging deadline, positive results or potentially unpopular decision to help show how you manage stressful situations.

Example: "My team worked on an application and had a presentation to senior executives. Marketing colleagues wanted updated statistics and project reports from our department, but a team member told me about a system bug during testing runs that affected the show-and-tell portion of the presentation. Though the deadline to share materials with the marketing team drew near, I communicated our troubleshooting took priority and pushed the submission deadline. We addressed the glitch the same day and sent our updated report the next morning. The marketing team appreciated my honesty and ultimately included the updated fix in their presentation to leaders."

7. What are some challenges you face while working with .NET Core?
A question about challenges can show an interviewer how you handle work situations, along with giving insight into your analytical and critical thinking skills. Try focusing your answer on specific situations from your past work experience or projects and describe how you overcame the challenges to best display your tenacity and ability to move past obstacles. Consider using the STAR method of providing answers to situational questions.

Example: "When I first became familiar with .NET Core, I often experienced server overloads and database issues when developing an application for my primary client. I noticed the landing pages worked, though they performed slowly with a lag time that might deter users. I connected with database administrators to monitor settings that allowed us to gain better performance while we further developed the app."

8. What is an action method?
Interviewers often seek to know you have a broad depth and understanding of industry terms, processes and practices. This question can help show your specific knowledge of IT concepts. Consider providing a concise answer that confidently addresses the question.

Example: "An action method executes activity when an HTTP request takes place. It is a controller class that has specific parameters. For example, action method must be public, rather than protected or private. It cannot get overloaded and it cannot be a static method."

9. How would you describe what a cookie is to someone not technologically savvy?
This question can showcase your ability to explain complex processes in simple ways. Because communication is an essential skill in nearly every industry, an interviewer might glean insight into your oral and written communication skills. Consider using straightforward descriptions that someone outside of the IT industry can understand when forming your answer.

Example: "A cookie is a small amount of data stored on your computer, mobile or other devices when you access a website. When you go back to the website again, it knows you have visited before. Cookies allow companies to tailor a website, promotion or offer to you specifically because they already know a bit about you as a consumer. Nearly all sites use cookies and they are relatively safe from viruses and malware."

10. What are caching and response caching in .NET Core?
An interviewer might ask this question to establish your awareness between various caching types and other software development aspects. Technical questions often require a precise response, so consider reviewing primary concepts used in the IT industry and .NET Core specifically to best be prepared.

Example: "Caching is a process that reduces the number of calls to the data source, improving the application's performance and scalability. It essentially stores a copy of the data instead of generating it each time you access the original source. For example, if you visit a specific website or app frequently, some data already on your device let the page run faster, giving you a better user experience. For data that frequently changes, response caching sets parameters for the headers that control caching."

Other .NET Core questions asked in a job interview
Here are 20 other examples of .NET Core questions you might get asked in an interview:

"Can you describe the dependency injection and what problem it solves?"
"How do you explain session and state management in .NET Core?"
"What does change token mean?"
"Please outline the role of startup class."
"Describe your level of software development proficiency, especially for .NET Core."

14. How can you improve Stored Procedure Performance?

You should focus on certain points for your Stored Procedure performance as below.

Use Proper indexing on tables.
Set NOCount ON|OFF - it will control some messages like - after running some update query you see messages - '0 rows affected'.
Use Select count(1) instead of count(*) for count function.
do not use prefix 'SP' while creating stored procedures as default system stored procedures also starts with prefix 'SP'.
Whenever it's required fetch data from the table with 'NOLOCK' keyword WITH(NOLOCK).
Set ANSI_Nulls ON|OFF- When it's ON it means a select statement will return zero results even if there are null values in the column. When It's OFF means select statement will return the corresponding rows with null values in columns. When you are setting it OFF means comparison operators do not follow ISO standards.
Set Quoted_Identifier ON|OFF - When it's ON means identifiers are delimited by double quotes and literals are delimited by single quotes. But when it's OFF means identifiers can not be delimited by quotation.

explain the concept of middleware in asp.net core
In ASP.NET Core, middleware is a software component that handles requests and responses. It is made up of one or more delegate functions. Each delegate function can:
Process the incoming request
Pass control to the next delegate function in the pipeline
Handle the request and produce a response
Perform certain actions before and after the next component is invoked in the pipeline 
Middleware can be used for different purposes, such as:
Authenticating a user
Handling errors
Serving static files such as JavaScript files, CSS files, images, etc. 
Middleware controls how applications behave on the HTTP request. It can do or check something with the request as it comes in or after it's completed. 
You can configure the Request Delegates using the Run, Map, and Use Extension Methods in ASP.NET Core. You can specify a Request Delegate using an in-line anonymous method (called in-line middleware) or specify the Request Delegates using a reusable method.

List of Most Frequently Asked .Net Interview Questions And Answers to Help You Prepare For The Upcoming Interview:

if you are looking for junior .net interview questions, you can look here

1. What is the ASP.NET Life Cycle, and list the types of Life Cycle?
Application Life Cycle: The user requests for accessing the application.
Page Life Cycle: Page Life Cycle has phases like initialization, restoring, execution, and page rendering.
2. What is the Yield keyword and use of in C#?
✔𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝘆𝗶𝗲𝗹𝗱 𝗿𝗲𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗻 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝗺𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗿𝘆 𝘂𝘀𝗮𝗴𝗲 .A yield keyword is used with an iterator method. It enables your to iterate over a collection one after the other without loading the entire collection into memory. It’s a powerful tool for writing more efficient and clean code.


3. Event vs Delegate
Delegate can be passed as a method parameter. An event is raised but cannot be passed as a method parameter.
You can override an event in C# but delegate not override.

Delegates are independent on events but, events can not be created without delegate.
A delegate is declared outside a class whereas, an event is declared inside a class.
Covariance and Contravariance provide extra flexibility to the delegate objects. On the other hand, event has no such concepts.
One difference that events and delegates have. That is delegates support ‘=’ assignment operator, events do not.
If you write your system with just delegate, the consumer may use ‘=’ operator to attach method without error. Now what issue this would introduce? As we said, the event can be subscribed by many components, so if we want to use delegates we must use ‘+=’ to support many methods. Suppose, someone forgets to use ‘+=’ and uses ‘=’, he will unknowingly detach all attached methods and attach only his method. This will be a big mess as other components will never receive event notification.

4. What is Attributes ?
Attributes are a powerful feature in the C# programming language that can add metadata information to your assemblies.Reflection is the ability to examine and modify the runtime behavior of an assembly at run time. Attributes can be used to provide additional information about a program element.

Attributes can be used for a variety of purposes, such as:

Documenting the code
Enforcing coding standards
Metadata Access at Runtime
Customizing the behavior of the compiler or runtime
5. Dynamic vs object
All variables are statically typed by default. However, you can use the dynamic keyword to declare a dynamically typed variable. This means that the compiler does not know the type of the variable and cannot perform type checking.


Dynamically typed variables can be useful in situations where you do not know the type of the variable at compile time. For example, you could use a dynamically typed variable to store a value that is returned from a method that you do not know the return type of.

6. Interface vs abstract class
Inheritance: One classes can implement multiple interface, whereas multiple classes can inherit from the one abstract class in C#.
Accessibility:Members of an interface are public by default, while members of an abstract class can have any accessibility level.
Implementation: In an interface, the implementing class must provide implementations for all methods
Constructors: An interface cannot have a constructor, while an abstract class can have a constructor.
Properties and fields: Interfaces can only have method signatures and events, while abstract classes can have fields, properties, and instance variables.
In general, you should use an interface if you want to specify a contract that can be implemented by multiple classes, and use an abstract class if you want to create a base class that provides some default behavior.

7. Linkedlist vs list
LinkedList and List are both data structures in C# that can be used to store a sequence of elements. However, they have different underlying implementations and performance characteristics.

Thread safety: LinkedList is not thread-safe, while List is thread-safe. This means that you can safely access a List from multiple threads at the same time, but you cannot safely access a LinkedList from multiple threads at the same time.
Flexibility: LinkedList is more flexible than List. This is because LinkedList can be used to store elements of any type, while List can only be used to store elements of the same type.
Memory usage: LinkedList uses more memory than List. This is because each node in a LinkedList needs to store a reference to the previous and next node.
Insertion and removal: The decision of whether to use LinkedList or List depends on the specific situation. If you need to frequently insert and remove elements from the middle of the list, then you should use LinkedList. If you need to frequently access elements at random indexes, then you should use List.
8. IEnumerable Vs IQueryable
IEnumerable and IQueryable are used for data manipulation in LINQ from the database and collections.

IQueryable exists in the System.Linq Namespace whereas IEnumerable in System.Collection.
IQueryable is suitable for querying data from out-memory (like remote database, service) collections. Whereas IEnumerable is good for In-Memory Collection query.
While querying data from a database, IQueryable executes a “select query” on server-side with all filters. Whereas IEnumerable not run with filters on server side.
IQueryable is beneficial for LINQ to SQL queries. Whereas IEnumerable beneficial for LINQ to Object
IEnumerable doesn’t support lazy loading. Hence not suitable for paging like scenarios. Whereas Iqueryable support lazy loading and suitable for paging like senearios.


9. System.Linq Methods
First() vs First𝐎𝐫𝐃𝐞𝐟𝐚𝐮𝐥𝐭() are both used to return the first element of a sequence.
Single() or SingleOrDefault() methods are also used to return the first element of a sequence, but they throw an exception if the sequence contains more than one element. There is exactly 1 result.
Last() or LastOrDefault() are both used to return the last element of the sequence
The major difference between First and FirstOrDefault is that First() will throw an exception if there is no result data for the supplied criteria whereas FirstOrDefault() will return the default value (null) if there is no result data. It is the same in others.


10. FirstOrDefault() vs SingleOrDefault()
SingleOrDefault() ensures that only one record matches the given condition, meaning it needs to check all rows, even when it finds one at the beginning of the table.
In the other hand, FirstOrDefault() will stop looking for rows after finding a row that matches the criteria.

11.ViewData vs ViewBag vs TempData in MVC
ViewData ,ViewBag and TempData are techniques that allow passing data from controllers to views in ASP.NET MVC. ViewData is a dictionary object that allows passing data as key-value pairs between the controller and the view. On the other hand, ViewBag is a dynamic object that allows passing data as properties from the controller to the view.

In general, ViewBag is easier to use but can be more error-prone than ViewData, as there is no compile-time checking. Therefore, it is recommended to use ViewData for strongly typed data and ViewBag for dynamic data. ViewData and ViewBag pass data to the view that is needed for the current request, but that is not needed for subsequent requests.

Use TempData to pass data to the view that is needed for the next request.


12. What is the concept of anonymous methods in C#?
Anonymous methods in C# are a way to define inline unnamed methods that can be assigned to delegate instances. They provide a short way to create small functions without declaring an entire named method. Anonymous methods use the delegate keyword and do not require a separate method declaration.

13. What are the different types of delegates in C#?
Singlecast Delegates: These delegates reference a single method with a matching signature. When the delegate is invoked, it calls the referenced method.
Multicast Delegates: These delegates can reference multiple methods with a matching signature. When the delegate is invoked, it calls all the referenced methods in the order they were added. Multicast delegates are created using the += or -= operators.
Generic Delegates: These delegates use generic type parameters, allowing them to work with multiple types without casting or boxing/unboxing. C# provides three built-in generic delegates: Func, Action, and Predicate.
14.What is a Nullable type in C# and how do you use it?
In C#, Nullable types are value types which can take null values. This capability is crucial because the value types don’t normally take null values. A Nullable type is declared using the ? symbol after the value type.

For instance, int? is a Nullable type based on the int type. You can assign any value which an int can take, plus an additional null value.

int? number = null;

15.Explain the concept of unmanaged resources in C# and how they can be managed.
Unmanaged resources are those not directly controlled by the .NET runtime, such as file handles, network connections, database connections, and other system resources. Because the .NET runtime’s garbage collector does not manage them, developers must handle such resources explicitly to avoid resource leaks or potential application instability.

To manage unmanaged resources properly, you can:

Implement the IDisposable interface in your class which uses unmanaged resources. The IDisposable interface provides a Dispose method for cleaning up unmanaged resources.
public FileWriter(string fileName)
    {
        fileStream = new FileStream(fileName, FileMode.Create);
    }
    public void Dispose()
    {
        if (fileStream != null)
        {
            fileStream.Dispose();
            fileStream = null;
        }
    }
}
Use the using statement to ensure the Dispose method is called automatically when the object goes out of scope.
using (FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("file.txt"))
{
    // Do some operations
}
In this example, the Dispose method will be called automatically when the using block is exited, ensuring proper cleanup of the unmanaged resources.

16.Explain the Tuple class and its use case in C#.
Tuples are useful in scenarios where you need to return multiple values from a method or store or pass around data without creating a specific data structure.

public Tuple<int, string> GetPersonInfo()
{
    int age = 30;
    string name = "John";
    return Tuple.Create(age, name);
}
var personInfo = GetPersonInfo();
Console.WriteLine($"Name: {personInfo.Item2}, Age: {personInfo.Item1}");
In C# 7.0, tuples were improved with the introduction of ValueTuple. ValueTuples are struct-based (instead of class-based) tuples that allow named elements and other enhancements:

public (int Age, string Name) GetPersonInfo()
{
    int age = 30;
    string name = "John";
    return (age, name);
}
var personInfo = GetPersonInfo();
Console.WriteLine($"Name: {personInfo.Name}, Age: {personInfo.Age}");
17. What is the difference between Dispose() and Finalize() methods?
Garbage collector only claims managed code memory.

There are wo ways to clean the unmanaged resource

1.Automatic way by Finalizer and GC

2.Manual way by Dispose Pattern

Finalize is a destructor and dispose is a function which is implemented via ‘Idisposable’ interface.
Finalize is nondeterministic, since it’s called by garbage collector. Dispose is a function and needs to be called by the client for clean up. In other finalize is automatically called by garbage collector while dispose needs to be called forcefully.
It is recommended to use the dispose() method because it is faster.
Dispose is used to close unmanaged resources stored by an object, like files or streams.
Finalize is used to clear up unmanaged resources owned by the current object before it is destroyed.
18. Managed and Unmanaged Resources in .NET
Code that executes under CLR execution environment is called as managed code. Unmanaged code executes outside CLR boundary. Unmanaged resources are those : file handles, pinned memory, COM objects, database connections etc. GC does not claim memory of unmanaged objects.

19. What is Dependency Injection
“Dependency Injection (DI) it is a technique for managing the dependencies between objects in a flexible and maintainable way.The idea behind Dependency Injection is to pass the dependencies to an object.

Constructor Injection: In the constructor injection, the injector supplies the service (dependency) through the client class constructor.
Property Injection: In the property injection (aka the Setter Injection), the injector supplies the dependency through a public property of the client class.
Method Injection: In this type of injection, the client class implements an interface which declares the method(s) to supply the dependency and the injector uses this interface to supply the dependency to the client class.
20. Async and await keywords in C#.
The async and await keywords in C# are used to write asynchronous code. Asynchronous code is code that can run concurrently with other code, without blocking the current thread. This can be useful for improving the performance and responsiveness of applications.

async: async and await keywords in C# are used to write asynchronous code. Asynchronous code is code that can run concurrently with other code, without blocking the current thread. This can be useful for improving the performance and responsiveness of applications.
await: The await keyword is used to pause the execution of an async method until an awaited task completes. It asynchronously waits for the task to complete and returns the result (if any) without blocking the main execution thread. The await keyword can only be used inside an async method.
We can use async and await keywords in C# to implement async programming in this easy way.

How do you handle exceptions globally in an ASP.NET Core Web API project?
Answer
Global exception handling in ASP.NET Core can be achieved using middleware. The ideal place to handle exceptions is in the middleware pipeline so that it is separate from your application logic, and can trap any unhandled exceptions.

One of the most effective ways is to use the built-in UseExceptionHandler middleware which captures synchronous and asynchronous exceptions. With this middleware, you can redirect to an error handling route or render an error response directly.

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    if (env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
    }
    else
    {
        app.UseExceptionHandler("/api/Error");
    }

    //... rest of the middleware
}
In the above code, when an exception is raised it is handled by the “/api/Error” route.

Another method of handling global exceptions is using UseDeveloperExceptionPage middleware which provides detailed exception information in the local development environment.


How to do database migrations in Entity Framework Core?
Answer
Entity Framework Core (EF Core) includes a feature called Migrations that allows you to make changes to your model and then propagate those changes to your database schema. Here’s a basic overview of performing a migration:

1. Install the necessary packages: EF Core requires certain NuGet packages to perform migrations. Make sure you have the basic Entity Framework Core and EF Core tools packages installed in your project.

2. Create a new Migration: Use the Add-Migration command and provide a name for your migration. This creates a new class in your Migrations folder that contains the changes to be made to the database schema.

Add-Migration MyFirstMigration
3. Update the database: Use the Update-Database command. This applies any pending migrations on the database. EF Core creates the database if it does not exist.

Update-Database
You may opt to provide a specific migration name if you want to update the database to a specific migration rather than the latest.

Remember to treat migrations as a part of your codebase. They need to be kept under source control and applied as part of your deployment process. Well-managed migrations are key to dealing with evolving database schemas.

How is routing implemented in ASP.NET Core MVC compared to ASP.NET MVC?
Answer
There are several differences in how routing is handled in ASP.NET Core MVC compared to ASP.NET MVC.

In ASP.NET MVC, routing was handled through a central RouteConfig file that includes rules for each controller and action method. These routing rules can be either attribute-based or convention-based.
On the other hand, ASP.NET Core MVC uses middleware for routing. It provides two types of routing methodologies – convention-based routing and attribute routing. All the routing information is configured in the Startup.cs file.
In ASP.NET Core MVC, we also have a new feature, Routing to Razor Pages. Razor Pages are a new aspect of ASP.NET Core MVC that allow you to create page-based programming model.
Additionally, ASP.NET Core MVC supports route constraints, which weren’t available in ASP.NET MVC. Route constraints let you restrict how the parameters in the route template are matched.
What are some of the best techniques for optimizing performance in .NET Core applications?
Answer
Optimizing performance in .NET Core applications could involve several techniques:

Caching: It’s about storing data somewhere for future use to speed up the application. .NET Core provides support for several different types of caching including in-memory caching, distributed caching, and response caching.
Asynchronous Programming: Use the async and await keywords to write asynchronous code that’s easier to read, write and manage.
Pooling: Techniques such as Object Pooling or Connection Pooling can be used to recycle objects or connections instead of creating and destroying them frequently.
Optimization of Data Access: Minimize the amount of data that you send over the network and reduce the number of server round trips.
Use of Middleware: Middleware components are used to handle requests and responses. Ensure that unnecessary middleware components are not registered.

Can you explain some possible strategies for managing session state in a distributed .NET Core application?
Answer
Managing session state in a distributed .NET Core application generally involves either a server-side or client-side session management approach.

Server-side session management: It store session data on the server. This strategy involves storing the session state in a database or in-memory data store like Redis. This allows applications running on multiple servers to have access to the shared session data.
Client-side session management: In this strategy, the session state is stored in a client side, usually in cookies or in local storage. This strategy eliminates the need to store session data on the server, which can be especially useful in applications with a large number of users.
Distributed Cache Session Management: ASP.NET Core provides IDistributedCache interface that you can use to store your session state.
Remember to always secure session data, especially when incorporating client-side session management strategies.


3. How do you explain what a service lifetime is?
An interviewer might ask this question to see if you understand the various lifetimes of registered services in .NET Core frameworks. A sound answer outlines the three different service lifetimes with specific explanations of each.

Example: "A service lifetime refers to how long an object lives after being created. The three typical lifetimes are transient, scoped and singleton. Transient lifetimes are ideal for stateless and lightweight services because they get created each time the service container gets used. Scoped lifetimes happen once every connection. Singleton lifetimes happen when initially created and again with each subsequent request from the service container."

6. Share a time you prioritised an IT task over something else and why.
Behavioral questions can help interviewers understand how you might react during a specific situation. Questions like this often give insight into your problem-solving abilities, time management skills and creative thinking. Consider giving an answer that involved a challenging deadline, positive results or potentially unpopular decision to help show how you manage stressful situations.

Example: "My team worked on an application and had a presentation to senior executives. Marketing colleagues wanted updated statistics and project reports from our department, but a team member told me about a system bug during testing runs that affected the show-and-tell portion of the presentation. Though the deadline to share materials with the marketing team drew near, I communicated our troubleshooting took priority and pushed the submission deadline. We addressed the glitch the same day and sent our updated report the next morning. The marketing team appreciated my honesty and ultimately included the updated fix in their presentation to leaders."

7. What are some challenges you face while working with .NET Core?
A question about challenges can show an interviewer how you handle work situations, along with giving insight into your analytical and critical thinking skills. Try focusing your answer on specific situations from your past work experience or projects and describe how you overcame the challenges to best display your tenacity and ability to move past obstacles. Consider using the STAR method of providing answers to situational questions.

Example: "When I first became familiar with .NET Core, I often experienced server overloads and database issues when developing an application for my primary client. I noticed the landing pages worked, though they performed slowly with a lag time that might deter users. I connected with database administrators to monitor settings that allowed us to gain better performance while we further developed the app."

8. What is an action method?
Interviewers often seek to know you have a broad depth and understanding of industry terms, processes and practices. This question can help show your specific knowledge of IT concepts. Consider providing a concise answer that confidently addresses the question.

Example: "An action method executes activity when an HTTP request takes place. It is a controller class that has specific parameters. For example, action method must be public, rather than protected or private. It cannot get overloaded and it cannot be a static method."

9. How would you describe what a cookie is to someone not technologically savvy?
This question can showcase your ability to explain complex processes in simple ways. Because communication is an essential skill in nearly every industry, an interviewer might glean insight into your oral and written communication skills. Consider using straightforward descriptions that someone outside of the IT industry can understand when forming your answer.

Example: "A cookie is a small amount of data stored on your computer, mobile or other devices when you access a website. When you go back to the website again, it knows you have visited before. Cookies allow companies to tailor a website, promotion or offer to you specifically because they already know a bit about you as a consumer. Nearly all sites use cookies and they are relatively safe from viruses and malware."

10. What are caching and response caching in .NET Core?
An interviewer might ask this question to establish your awareness between various caching types and other software development aspects. Technical questions often require a precise response, so consider reviewing primary concepts used in the IT industry and .NET Core specifically to best be prepared.

Example: "Caching is a process that reduces the number of calls to the data source, improving the application's performance and scalability. It essentially stores a copy of the data instead of generating it each time you access the original source. For example, if you visit a specific website or app frequently, some data already on your device let the page run faster, giving you a better user experience. For data that frequently changes, response caching sets parameters for the headers that control caching."

Other .NET Core questions asked in a job interview
Here are 20 other examples of .NET Core questions you might get asked in an interview:

"Can you describe the dependency injection and what problem it solves?"
"How do you explain session and state management in .NET Core?"
"What does change token mean?"
"Please outline the role of startup class."
"Describe your level of software development proficiency, especially for .NET Core."
"What is the difference between generic host and web host?"
"Can you explain model validation in one sentence**?"
"How would you explain in-memory cache and distributed caching to someone not familiar with the terms?"
"What steps would you take to enable cross-origin requests and prevent cross-site scripting?"
"Please explain the concept of middleware."
"How are models, viewers and controllers used?"
"What is area in relation to .NET and how would you describe it?"
"What is the role of configure services and the configure method?"
"How do you identify and handle errors in .NET Core?"
"Can you run .NET Core applications in docker containers?"
"What is attribute routing?"
"Explain how attribute-based routing works."
"What are caching and response caching?"
"How does configuration work in .NET?"
"What is the difference between a Kestrel and an Internet Information Service (IIS)?"

14. How can you improve Stored Procedure Performance?

You should focus on certain points for your Stored Procedure performance as below.

Use Proper indexing on tables.
Set NOCount ON|OFF - it will control some messages like - after running some update query you see messages - '0 rows affected'.
Use Select count(1) instead of count(*) for count function.
do not use prefix 'SP' while creating stored procedures as default system stored procedures also starts with prefix 'SP'.
Whenever it's required fetch data from the table with 'NOLOCK' keyword WITH(NOLOCK).
Set ANSI_Nulls ON|OFF- When it's ON it means a select statement will return zero results even if there are null values in the column. When It's OFF means select statement will return the corresponding rows with null values in columns. When you are setting it OFF means comparison operators do not follow ISO standards.
Set Quoted_Identifier ON|OFF - When it's ON means identifiers are delimited by double quotes and literals are delimited by single quotes. But when it's OFF means identifiers can not be delimited by quotation.

1. How to implement asynchronous programming?
Asynchronous programming in .NET is usually implemented using the async and await keywords. Asynchronous programming is commonly used for I/O bound operations, such as file access, database queries, and network communication.

Asynchronous programming is particularly useful in web application development to prevent main-thread blocking while performing synchronous I/O operations.

2. What do you know about dependency injection?
Dependency Injection is the implementation of Inversion of Control, where a class no longer initializes its dependencies but instead accepts them through constructors or properties.

Three commonly used service lifetimes are Singleton, Scoped, and Transient.

Singleton: The instance is created once and used throughout the application's runtime.
Scoped: Created a new one for each scope, usually each request in the web application.
Transient: Created every time the dependency is called.
Dependency injection enhances modularity and flexibility and simplifies unit testing by replacing actual dependencies with mockups.

3. Can you explain the SOLID principles?
The SOLID principles provide five guidelines for developing code that is easy to maintain and extend.

Single Responsibility: Each class can only have one responsibility.
Open/Closed: Each class must be open for extension and closed for modification.
Liskov Substitution: The parent class must be able to be replaced by any derived class without causing errors in the program.
Interface Segregation: Each class should only implement the interfaces that will actually be used.
Dependency Inversion: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both must rely on abstractions.
4. What do you know about unit testing?
Unit testing is used to ensure application logic runs according to specifications. We can use unit testing frameworks such as NUnit or xUnit. Mocking libraries such as Moq can be used to create mock objects.

The code coverage of the unit tests must reach the specified percentage. The ideal value for code coverage is around 80%. We can use tools such as SonarCube or JetBrains dotCover to measure the code coverage.

5. How do you implement a locking mechanism?
Locking mechanisms are important for managing resources accessed together in multithreading to avoid race conditions and deadlocks. Locking mechanisms can be implemented using. lock, Monitor, Mutex, and Semaphore.

6. What do you know about LINQ?
LINQ (Language-Integrated Query) is a feature that allows writing queries to data sources in a declarative and consistent way. LINQ can be used to perform queries to memory (lists or arrays), databases, and XML.

We can apply LINQ to query the database using an ORM such as Entity Framework. Each LINQ query will be converted into an SQL query and executed on the database.

7. How do you troubleshoot?
The troubleshooting process can be done using the Visual Studio debugger to check variable values and program execution flow. Utilizing logging functionality is beneficial in identifying and resolving errors that may arise while troubleshooting.

For performance-related problems, we can use profiling tools such as Visual Studio Diagnostic Tools or JetBrains dotTrace.
