How do you handle exceptions globally in an ASP.NET Core Web API project?
Answer
Global exception handling in ASP.NET Core can be achieved using middleware. The ideal place to handle exceptions is in the middleware pipeline so that it is separate from your application logic, and can trap any unhandled exceptions.

One of the most effective ways is to use the built-in UseExceptionHandler middleware which captures synchronous and asynchronous exceptions. With this middleware, you can redirect to an error handling route or render an error response directly.

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    if (env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
    }
    else
    {
        app.UseExceptionHandler("/api/Error");
    }

    //... rest of the middleware
}
In the above code, when an exception is raised it is handled by the “/api/Error” route.

Another method of handling global exceptions is using UseDeveloperExceptionPage middleware which provides detailed exception information in the local development environment.


How to do database migrations in Entity Framework Core?
Answer
Entity Framework Core (EF Core) includes a feature called Migrations that allows you to make changes to your model and then propagate those changes to your database schema. Here’s a basic overview of performing a migration:

1. Install the necessary packages: EF Core requires certain NuGet packages to perform migrations. Make sure you have the basic Entity Framework Core and EF Core tools packages installed in your project.

2. Create a new Migration: Use the Add-Migration command and provide a name for your migration. This creates a new class in your Migrations folder that contains the changes to be made to the database schema.

Add-Migration MyFirstMigration
3. Update the database: Use the Update-Database command. This applies any pending migrations on the database. EF Core creates the database if it does not exist.

Update-Database
You may opt to provide a specific migration name if you want to update the database to a specific migration rather than the latest.

Remember to treat migrations as a part of your codebase. They need to be kept under source control and applied as part of your deployment process. Well-managed migrations are key to dealing with evolving database schemas.

How is routing implemented in ASP.NET Core MVC compared to ASP.NET MVC?
Answer
There are several differences in how routing is handled in ASP.NET Core MVC compared to ASP.NET MVC.

In ASP.NET MVC, routing was handled through a central RouteConfig file that includes rules for each controller and action method. These routing rules can be either attribute-based or convention-based.
On the other hand, ASP.NET Core MVC uses middleware for routing. It provides two types of routing methodologies – convention-based routing and attribute routing. All the routing information is configured in the Startup.cs file.
In ASP.NET Core MVC, we also have a new feature, Routing to Razor Pages. Razor Pages are a new aspect of ASP.NET Core MVC that allow you to create page-based programming model.
Additionally, ASP.NET Core MVC supports route constraints, which weren’t available in ASP.NET MVC. Route constraints let you restrict how the parameters in the route template are matched.
What are some of the best techniques for optimizing performance in .NET Core applications?
Answer
Optimizing performance in .NET Core applications could involve several techniques:

Caching: It’s about storing data somewhere for future use to speed up the application. .NET Core provides support for several different types of caching including in-memory caching, distributed caching, and response caching.
Asynchronous Programming: Use the async and await keywords to write asynchronous code that’s easier to read, write and manage.
Pooling: Techniques such as Object Pooling or Connection Pooling can be used to recycle objects or connections instead of creating and destroying them frequently.
Optimization of Data Access: Minimize the amount of data that you send over the network and reduce the number of server round trips.
Use of Middleware: Middleware components are used to handle requests and responses. Ensure that unnecessary middleware components are not registered.

Can you explain some possible strategies for managing session state in a distributed .NET Core application?
Answer
Managing session state in a distributed .NET Core application generally involves either a server-side or client-side session management approach.

Server-side session management: It store session data on the server. This strategy involves storing the session state in a database or in-memory data store like Redis. This allows applications running on multiple servers to have access to the shared session data.
Client-side session management: In this strategy, the session state is stored in a client side, usually in cookies or in local storage. This strategy eliminates the need to store session data on the server, which can be especially useful in applications with a large number of users.
Distributed Cache Session Management: ASP.NET Core provides IDistributedCache interface that you can use to store your session state.
Remember to always secure session data, especially when incorporating client-side session management strategies.


3. How do you explain what a service lifetime is?
An interviewer might ask this question to see if you understand the various lifetimes of registered services in .NET Core frameworks. A sound answer outlines the three different service lifetimes with specific explanations of each.

Example: "A service lifetime refers to how long an object lives after being created. The three typical lifetimes are transient, scoped and singleton. Transient lifetimes are ideal for stateless and lightweight services because they get created each time the service container gets used. Scoped lifetimes happen once every connection. Singleton lifetimes happen when initially created and again with each subsequent request from the service container."

6. Share a time you prioritised an IT task over something else and why.
Behavioral questions can help interviewers understand how you might react during a specific situation. Questions like this often give insight into your problem-solving abilities, time management skills and creative thinking. Consider giving an answer that involved a challenging deadline, positive results or potentially unpopular decision to help show how you manage stressful situations.

Example: "My team worked on an application and had a presentation to senior executives. Marketing colleagues wanted updated statistics and project reports from our department, but a team member told me about a system bug during testing runs that affected the show-and-tell portion of the presentation. Though the deadline to share materials with the marketing team drew near, I communicated our troubleshooting took priority and pushed the submission deadline. We addressed the glitch the same day and sent our updated report the next morning. The marketing team appreciated my honesty and ultimately included the updated fix in their presentation to leaders."

7. What are some challenges you face while working with .NET Core?
A question about challenges can show an interviewer how you handle work situations, along with giving insight into your analytical and critical thinking skills. Try focusing your answer on specific situations from your past work experience or projects and describe how you overcame the challenges to best display your tenacity and ability to move past obstacles. Consider using the STAR method of providing answers to situational questions.

Example: "When I first became familiar with .NET Core, I often experienced server overloads and database issues when developing an application for my primary client. I noticed the landing pages worked, though they performed slowly with a lag time that might deter users. I connected with database administrators to monitor settings that allowed us to gain better performance while we further developed the app."

8. What is an action method?
Interviewers often seek to know you have a broad depth and understanding of industry terms, processes and practices. This question can help show your specific knowledge of IT concepts. Consider providing a concise answer that confidently addresses the question.

Example: "An action method executes activity when an HTTP request takes place. It is a controller class that has specific parameters. For example, action method must be public, rather than protected or private. It cannot get overloaded and it cannot be a static method."

9. How would you describe what a cookie is to someone not technologically savvy?
This question can showcase your ability to explain complex processes in simple ways. Because communication is an essential skill in nearly every industry, an interviewer might glean insight into your oral and written communication skills. Consider using straightforward descriptions that someone outside of the IT industry can understand when forming your answer.

Example: "A cookie is a small amount of data stored on your computer, mobile or other devices when you access a website. When you go back to the website again, it knows you have visited before. Cookies allow companies to tailor a website, promotion or offer to you specifically because they already know a bit about you as a consumer. Nearly all sites use cookies and they are relatively safe from viruses and malware."

10. What are caching and response caching in .NET Core?
An interviewer might ask this question to establish your awareness between various caching types and other software development aspects. Technical questions often require a precise response, so consider reviewing primary concepts used in the IT industry and .NET Core specifically to best be prepared.

Example: "Caching is a process that reduces the number of calls to the data source, improving the application's performance and scalability. It essentially stores a copy of the data instead of generating it each time you access the original source. For example, if you visit a specific website or app frequently, some data already on your device let the page run faster, giving you a better user experience. For data that frequently changes, response caching sets parameters for the headers that control caching."

Other .NET Core questions asked in a job interview
Here are 20 other examples of .NET Core questions you might get asked in an interview:

"Can you describe the dependency injection and what problem it solves?"
"How do you explain session and state management in .NET Core?"
"What does change token mean?"
"Please outline the role of startup class."
"Describe your level of software development proficiency, especially for .NET Core."

14. How can you improve Stored Procedure Performance?

You should focus on certain points for your Stored Procedure performance as below.

Use Proper indexing on tables.
Set NOCount ON|OFF - it will control some messages like - after running some update query you see messages - '0 rows affected'.
Use Select count(1) instead of count(*) for count function.
do not use prefix 'SP' while creating stored procedures as default system stored procedures also starts with prefix 'SP'.
Whenever it's required fetch data from the table with 'NOLOCK' keyword WITH(NOLOCK).
Set ANSI_Nulls ON|OFF- When it's ON it means a select statement will return zero results even if there are null values in the column. When It's OFF means select statement will return the corresponding rows with null values in columns. When you are setting it OFF means comparison operators do not follow ISO standards.
Set Quoted_Identifier ON|OFF - When it's ON means identifiers are delimited by double quotes and literals are delimited by single quotes. But when it's OFF means identifiers can not be delimited by quotation.

what is a temporary view in sql
A temporary view in SQL is a virtual table that is based on the results of a SQL query or a DataFrame. Temporary views are not stored in the catalog and are only visible to the current session. They are automatically dropped when the session ends or when you explicitly drop them using DROP VIEW


The Global.asax file in ASP.NET is an optional file that provides a way to handle global application-level events and settings. It serves as the entry point and central configuration file for an ASP.NET application.

he Global.asax file in ASP.NET allows you to handle application-level events, implement error handling, manage sessions, define URL routing rules, and set global configuration settings. It provides a central place to handle various aspects of your application's behavior and lifecycle.

What is the ASP.NET page life cycle and why is it important?
The ASP.NET page life cycle refers to the sequence of events that occur during the processing of a web page in an ASP.NET application. It starts when a user requests a page and ends when the page is fully rendered and sent back to the client.

The ASP.NET page life cycle consists of several stages, each representing a specific phase of the page processing. Here are the main stages:

Page Request: The web server receives a request for a page.
Start: The page's initialization occurs, including loading the page's controls and their properties.
Page Load: The page's controls are populated with data, and the page's logic is executed.
Validation: The user input is validated, and any validation errors are collected.
Postback Event Handling: If there is a postback event, like a button click, the corresponding event handler is executed
PreRender: The page prepares for rendering, and the state of the controls is finalized.
Render: The HTML markup for the page is generated.
Unload: The page is unloaded, and resources are released.
Understanding the ASP.NET page life cycle is important for several reasons:

Control and Manipulation: By understanding each stage of the life cycle, developers can control and manipulate the behavior and appearance of the page at specific points. This allows them to customize the page's behavior based on the current state.
State Management: The life cycle helps manage the state of controls and their values across postbacks. It ensures that user input and control values are properly persisted and restored during subsequent requests.
Event Handling: The life cycle provides a clear structure for handling events raised by controls on the page. Developers can write code to respond to specific events at the appropriate stage of the life cycle.
Performance Optimization: Knowledge of the life cycle can help optimize the performance of ASP.NET applications. Developers can take advantage of the life cycle stages to perform resource-intensive operations at the appropriate time and avoid unnecessary processing.
Overall, understanding the ASP.NET page life cycle is crucial for building robust and efficient web applications with ASP.NET. It allows developers to control the flow of execution, handle events, manage state, and optimize performance effectively.

what is a query string in asp.net
A query string in ASP.NET is a technique for sending data from one webform to another through the URL. It is a method for storing state information on the client end. 
A query string is made up of two parts: field and value. Each pair is separated by an ampersand (&). The question mark (?) in a query string indicates the beginning of a query string and its value. 

Object pooling is a design pattern that keeps a group of objects in memory for reuse. 
Reduces resource overhead
Object pooling is useful when multiple instances of a class are needed, but the class is expensive to create or manage.
Improves performance
Object pooling can improve the performance of memory-intensive applications by reducing the overhead of initialization, allocation, and disposal of objects.
Reduces processing power
Object pooling can optimize performance by reducing the processing power required of the CPU to run repetitive create and destroy calls.

Connection pooling allows you to reuse connections rather than create a new one every time the ADO.NET data provider needs to establish a connection to the underlying database. Connection pooling behavior can be controlled by using connection string options
Connection pooling is simple to implement, but it makes a huge difference in performance when more users are logged in. By default, a connection string is enabled with connection pooling. By default, the maximum number of pools is 100, minimum is 0


App. config file is used to set configuration parameters externally for desktop / stand-alone applications. Web. config file is used to set configuration parameters externally for web applications.
App.config and web.config are configuration files that set configuration parameters externally for applications. The choice of configuration file name depends on the hosting environment. 
Here are some differences between app.config and web.config: 
Usage: App.config is used for Windows Forms, Windows Services, Console Apps, and WPF applications. Web.config is used for asp.net web projects and web services.
Hosting environment: If you're using IIS to host your service, use a Web.config file. If you're using any other hosting environment, use an App.config file.
Location: Web.config files are located in the application's root directory.

What is user controls?
A user control is a collection of Windows Forms controls encapsulated in a common container. This kind of control is referred to as a composite control. The contained controls are called constituent controls. User controls derive from the UserControl class. User controls are designed like Forms, with a visual designer.

Partial view in ASP.NET MVC is a special view that renders a portion of view content. It is just like a user control of a web form application.

C# Jagged Arrays

Javatpoint
https://www.javatpoint.com › c-sharp-jagged-array
In C#, jagged array is also known as "array of arrays" because its elements are arrays. The element size of jagged array can be different.


Both these methods are used to convert a value to a string. The difference is Convert. ToString() method handles null whereas the ToString() doesn't handle null in C#.

A hashtable stores key-value pairs. It retrieves the values by comparing the hash value of the keys.



SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM Employee WHERE SALARY < (SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM Employee);


duplicate record
SELECT OrderID, COUNT(OrderID)
FROM Orders
GROUP BY OrderID
HAVING COUNT(OrderID) > 1

By using the DISTINCT keyword, the GROUP BY clause, and the INNER JOIN statement, we can remove duplicates from a table in SQL.


What is the use of case when in SQL?
The SQL CASE Expression

The CASE expression goes through conditions and returns a value when the first condition is met (like an if-then-else statement). So, once a condition is true, it will stop reading and return the result. If no conditions are true, it returns the value in the ELSE clause.
