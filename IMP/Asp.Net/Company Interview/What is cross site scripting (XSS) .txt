How Generics are helpful in C# ?
Generics in C# allow you to write flexible and reusable code by creating classes, methods, or interfaces that can work with different data types.

Following are the benefits of using generics:

1) Code Reusability: Generics allow you to write code that can work with multiple data types without duplicating logic.

2) Type Safety: The compiler enforces type safety, catching type-related errors at compile-time rather than runtime.

3) Performance: Generics can be more efficient than using object types, as they eliminate the need for boxing/unboxing operations.
