Exceptions are the errors that happen at runtime. 
Exception handling is the technique to handle this runtime error in our application code. 
If any error is thrown in web API that is caught, it is translated into an HTTP response with status code 500- "Internal Server Error".

There are many ways to handle the exceptio
Web API supports many ways of exception handling. Following is a summary of exception handling in Web API described in this article:
We can use HttpResponseException when the possibility of exception is known by us. 
In the above example, we have thrown exception using HttpResponseException class as we know there is a chance to employee not found in the database. 
We can use exception filter to catch unhandled exceptions on action/controllers. 
We can use Exception Handlers to catch any type of unhandled exception application-wide.
CreateErrorResponse method of Request object helps us to return meaningful error code and message to the client. 
CreateErrorResponse creates an instance of HttpError object and returns it as HttpResponseMessage object.


Reusability – By using generic classes and methods, you can write code that can work with multiple data types without the need to create a separate version for each data type. 
This makes your code more reusable and reduces the amount of code you need to write.
Performance – Generic classes and methods allow you to write efficient code that avoids the overhead of type conversions. 
This is because the type of the data is known at compile-time, allowing the compiler to generate optimized code.
Code maintainability – By using generic classes and methods, you can write code that is easier to maintain and understand.
This is because you can define a single implementation that works with multiple data types, making it easier to change and test.

find the no of occurance in the string
we take the input from Console and then remove the blank spaces from the input if any. 
Check the length of the input message and if it is greater than 0, 
then using for loop we calculate the number of occurrences of each character,
Console.Write("Enter the string : ");
            string message = Console.ReadLine();

            //Remove the empty spaces from the message
            message = message.Replace(" ", string.Empty);
            
            while (message.Length > 0)
            {
                Console.Write(message[0] + " : ");
                int count = 0;
                for (int j = 0; j < message.Length; j++)
                {
                    if (message[0] == message[j])
                    {

hoisting in javascript
Hoisting is the default behavior in JavaScript where declarations of variables and functions 
are moved to the top of their respective scopes during the compilation phase. 
This ensures that regardless of where variables and functions are declared within a scope, they are accessible throughout that scope.

Features of Hoisting
Declarations are hoisted, not initializations.
Allows calling functions before their declarations.
All variable and function declarations are processed before any code execution.
Undeclared variables are implicitly created as global variables when assigned a value.
Note: JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations.

JavaScript allocates memory for all variables and functions defined in the program before execution.

how would you handle cors issue
In this article, we covered the key steps to handle CORS issues:

Package Installation: Ensure that the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Cors package is installed in your project.
Configure CORS Services: In the ConfigureServices method of your Startup.cs file, add the CORS services specifying allowed origins, methods, and headers.
Use CORS Middleware: In the Configure method of Startup.cs, apply the CORS policy using the app.UseCors middleware.
Testing: Verify the solution by testing your API with your front-end application. Ensure that requests are allowed without encountering CORS errors.
Additionally, we highlighted some considerations such as wildcard origins, handling credentials, and fine-grained control over CORS policies. It's essential to strike a balance between security and flexibility, tailoring CORS settings to fit the specific requirements of your application.

By following these steps and considering the nuances of CORS configuration, you can establish a secure and seamless connection between your ASP.NET Core Web API and frontend, providing a smooth user experience while maintaining the integrity of your application's security.
ross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security feature implemented by web browsers to prevent web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. When developing a web application, especially if it involves making API requests to a different domain, you might encounter CORS-related errors. In this article, we'll explore how to resolve CORS issues in an ASP.NET Core Web API.

Understanding CORS
Before diving into solutions, let's understand why CORS issues occur. When a web page tries to make a request to a different domain than the one it came from, the browser blocks the request by default. This is a security measure to prevent unauthorized access to resources on a different domain.

CORS in ASP.NET Core
ASP.NET Core provides built-in support for handling CORS. The CORS middleware can be configured in the Startup.cs file to specify which origins, HTTP methods, and headers are allowed for your API.

delete duplicate record from atable which dont have primary key
Deleting duplicate records from a table without a primary key can be challenging because you don't have a unique identifier to differentiate between duplicate records. 
However, you can still use a combination of columns to identify duplicates and remove them. Here's a general approach using SQL:
Identify Duplicate Records: Use the GROUP BY clause along with aggregate functions to identify duplicate records based on specific columns. For example, 
if you have columns column1, column2, and column3, you can identify duplicates as records having the same values in all these columns.
sql
Copy code
SELECT column1, column2, column3, COUNT(*)
FROM your_table
GROUP BY column1, column2, column3
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
Delete Duplicate Records: Once you have identified the duplicate records, you can use a common table expression (CTE) or a subquery to delete all but one instance of each duplicate.
sql
Copy code
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT column1, column2, column3,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY column1, column2, column3 ORDER BY (SELECT NULL)) AS RowNumber
    FROM your_table
)
DELETE FROM CTE WHERE RowNumber > 1;

            for(int j = i+1; j < arr.Length; j++){  
                if(arr[i] == arr[j]){  
                    count++;  
                    //To avoid counting same element again  
                    fr[j] = visited;  
                }  
            }  
            if(fr[i] != visited)  
                fr[i] = count;  
        }  
        
        //Displays the frequency of each element present in array  
        Console.WriteLine("---------------------");  
        Console.WriteLine(" Element | Frequency");  
        Console.WriteLine("---------------------");  
        for(int i = 0; i < fr.Length; i++){  
            if(fr[i] != visited)  
                Console.WriteLine("    " + arr[i] + "    |    " + fr[i]);  
        }  
        Console.WriteLine("---------------------");
