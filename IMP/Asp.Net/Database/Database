When you create a simple database with the CREATE DATABASE command, SQL Server creates two files: 
A data file (.mdf)
A transaction log file (.ldf)
The data file contains data and objects like tables, indexes, stored procedures, and views. The transaction log file records all transactions and the database modifications made by each transaction. 
Data files can be of two types: primary or secondary. The primary data file contains startup information for the database and points to other files in the database.
