How does Connection Pooling work?

Connection Pooling involves sharing your connection with others so that multiple users may access the data pool. 
This process reuses active connections with an identical connection string to reduce the time that you might spend opening or closing new connections. 
By using Connection Pooling, you can avoid creating a new connection each time that colleagues request access to a data set. 
A Connection Manager monitors existing connections by keeping a list of links, permitting access to data sets on request. 
By using this system, you can then share data with colleagues more easily, boosting general productivity."
