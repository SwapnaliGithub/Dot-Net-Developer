Reusability – By using generic classes and methods, you can write code that can work with multiple data types without the need to create a separate version for each data type. 
This makes your code more reusable and reduces the amount of code you need to write.
Performance – Generic classes and methods allow you to write efficient code that avoids the overhead of type conversions. 
This is because the type of the data is known at compile-time, allowing the compiler to generate optimized code.
Code maintainability – By using generic classes and methods, you can write code that is easier to maintain and understand.
This is because you can define a single implementation that works with multiple data types, making it easier to change and test.

find the no of occurance in the string
we take the input from Console and then remove the blank spaces from the input if any. 
Check the length of the input message and if it is greater than 0, 
then using for loop we calculate the number of occurrences of each character,
Console.Write("Enter the string : ");
            string message = Console.ReadLine();

            //Remove the empty spaces from the message
            message = message.Replace(" ", string.Empty);
            
            while (message.Length > 0)
            {
                Console.Write(message[0] + " : ");
                int count = 0;
                for (int j = 0; j < message.Length; j++)
                {
                    if (message[0] == message[j])
                    {
                        count++;
                    }
                }
                Console.WriteLine(count);
                message = message.Replace(message[0].ToString(), string.Empty);
            }

hoisting in javascript
Hoisting is the default behavior in JavaScript where declarations of variables and functions 
are moved to the top of their respective scopes during the compilation phase. 
This ensures that regardless of where variables and functions are declared within a scope, they are accessible throughout that scope.

Features of Hoisting
Declarations are hoisted, not initializations.
Allows calling functions before their declarations.
All variable and function declarations are processed before any code execution.
Undeclared variables are implicitly created as global variables when assigned a value.
Note: JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations.

JavaScript allocates memory for all variables and functions defined in the program before execution.

var and let in js
Parameters	Var	Let
Introduction in JavaScript	Var has been a part of JavaScript since its inception.	Let was introduced in the ES 2015 (ES6) version of JavaScript.
Scope	Var is globally scoped.	Let is block-scoped.
Access and Declaration	Var can be declared and accessed globally.	Let can be declared globally, but its access is limited to the block in which it is declared.
Redeclaration	Variables declared using var can be re-declared and updated within the same scope.	Variables declared with let can be updated but not re-declared within the same scope.

delete duplicate record from atable which dont have primary key
Deleting duplicate records from a table without a primary key can be challenging because you don't have a unique identifier to differentiate between duplicate records. 
However, you can still use a combination of columns to identify duplicates and remove them. Here's a general approach using SQL:
Identify Duplicate Records: Use the GROUP BY clause along with aggregate functions to identify duplicate records based on specific columns. For example, 
if you have columns column1, column2, and column3, you can identify duplicates as records having the same values in all these columns.
sql
Copy code
SELECT column1, column2, column3, COUNT(*)
FROM your_table
GROUP BY column1, column2, column3
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
Delete Duplicate Records: Once you have identified the duplicate records, you can use a common table expression (CTE) or a subquery to delete all but one instance of each duplicate.
sql
Copy code
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT column1, column2, column3,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY column1, column2, column3 ORDER BY (SELECT NULL)) AS RowNumber
    FROM your_table
)
DELETE FROM CTE WHERE RowNumber > 1;

find the freq of each ele in an array
 int [] arr = new int [] {1, 2, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 5, 1};   
        //Array fr will store frequencies of element  
        int [] fr = new int [arr.Length];  
        int visited = -1;  
        
        for(int i = 0; i < arr.Length; i++){  
            int count = 1;  
            for(int j = i+1; j < arr.Length; j++){  
                if(arr[i] == arr[j]){  
                    count++;  
                    //To avoid counting same element again  
                    fr[j] = visited;  
                }  
            }  
            if(fr[i] != visited)  
                fr[i] = count;  
        }  
        
        //Displays the frequency of each element present in array  
        Console.WriteLine("---------------------");  
        Console.WriteLine(" Element | Frequency");  
        Console.WriteLine("---------------------");  
        for(int i = 0; i < fr.Length; i++){  
            if(fr[i] != visited)  
                Console.WriteLine("    " + arr[i] + "    |    " + fr[i]);  
        }  
        Console.WriteLine("---------------------");
